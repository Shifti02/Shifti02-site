                Ahania, the embodiment of sorrow, continues to lament the separation and destruction brought about by Urizen’s authoritarian rule and the resulting conflict.

  Her lamentation serves to highlight the emotional and spiritual cost of the struggle between father and son. Fuzon’s death is a pivotal event, symbolizing the ultimate failure of rebellion against an entrenched power.

  His death also represents the cyclical nature of destruction and creation, a recurring theme in Blake's mythopoeia.

1: Forth flew the arrows of pestilence
Round the pale living Corse on the tree 
2: For in Urizens slumbers of abstraction
In the infinite ages of Eternity:
When his Nerves of joy melted & flow'd
A white Lake on the dark blue air
In perturb'd pain and dismal torment 
Now stretching out, now swift conglobing.
3: Effluvia vapor'd above
In noxious clouds; these hover'd thick
Over the disorganiz'd Immortal,
Till petrific pain scurfd o'er the Lakes 
As the bones of man, solid & dark
4: The clouds of disease hover'd wide
Around the Immortal in torment
Perching around the hurtling bones
Disease on disease, shape on shape, 
Winged screaming in blood & torment.
5: The Eternal Prophet beat on his anvils
Enrag'd in the desolate darkness 
He forg'd nets of iron around
And Los threw them around the bones 
6: The shapes screaming flutter'd vain
Some combin'd into muscles & glands
Some organs for craving and lust
Most remain'd on the tormented void:
Urizens army of horrors. 
7: Round the pale living Corse on the Tree
Forty years flew the arrows of pestilence
8: Wailing and terror and woe
Ran thro' all his dismal world:
Forty years all his sons & daughters 
Felt their skulls harden; then Asia
Arose in the pendulous deep.
9: They reptilize upon the Earth.
10: Fuzon groand on the Tree.
