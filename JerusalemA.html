                This passage describes Albion's Couch as a void outside of existence that engulfs itself and becomes a womb. Albion, a central figure in Blake's mythology.On the right side of the archway, Los, another important character in Blake's mythology, speaks about the concept of half friendship being the bitterest enmity.On the left side of the archway, there is a phrase written in reversed writing: "Every Thing has its Vermin O Spectre of the Sleeping Dead!"Following the depiction above the archway, there is a note from the author addressed to the public. Here, Blake speaks about his return to public attention after a period of "slumber".

[Above the archway:]
There is a Void, outside of Existence, which if enterd into
Englobes itself & becomes a Womb, such was Albions Couch
A pleasant Shadow of Repose calld Albions lovely Land
His Sublime & Pathos become Two Rocks fixd in the Earth
His Reason his Spectrous Power, covers them above 
Jerusalem his Emanation is a Stone laying beneath
O [ Albion behold Pitying ]behold the Vision of Albion t
[On right side of archway:]
Half Friendship is the bitterest Enmity said Los
As he enterd the Door of Death for Albions sake Inspired
The long sufferings of God are not for ever there is a Judgment 0
[On left side, in reversed writing:]
Every Thing has its Vermin O Spectre of the Sleeping Dead!
<p class="poisontree">To the Public
After my three years slumber on the banks of the Ocean, I again display my Giant forms to the Public: My former Giants & Fairies having reciev'd the highest reward possible: the [ love ]and [ friendship ]of those with whom to be connected, is to be [ blessed ]: I cannot doubt that this more consolidated & extended Work, will be as kindly recieved

The Enthusiasm of the following Poem, the Author hopes t [ no Reader will think presumptuousness or arroganc [e] when he is reminded that the Ancients acknowledge their love to their Deities, to the full as Enthusiastically as I have who Acknowledge mine for my Saviour and Lord, for they were wholly absorb'd in their Gods.]I also hope the Reader will be with me, wholly One in Jesus our Lord, who is the God [ of Fire ]and Lord [ of Love ]to whom the Ancients look'd and saw his day afar off, with trembling & amazement.

The Spirit of Jesus is continual forgiveness of Sin: he who waits to be righteous before he enters into the Saviours kingdom, the Divine Body; will never enter there. I am perhaps the most sinful of men! I pretend not to holiness! yet I pretend to love, to see, to converse with daily, as man with man, & the more to have an interest in the Friend of Sinners. Therefore [ Dear ]Reader, [ forgive ]what you do not approve, & [ love ]me for this energetic exertion of my talent.

<p class="poisontree">Reader! [ lover ]of books! [ lover ]of heaven,
<p class="poisontree">And of that God from whom [ all books are given, ]
<p class="poisontree">Who in mysterious Sinais awful cave
<p class="poisontree">To Man the wond'rous art of writing gave,
<p class="poisontree">Again he speaks in thunder and in fire!5
<p class="poisontree">Thunder of Thought, & flames of fierce desire:
<p class="poisontree">Even from the depths of Hell his voice I hear,
<p class="poisontree">Within the unfathomd caverns of my Ear.
<p class="poisontree">Therefore I print; nor vain my types shall be:
<p class="poisontree">Heaven, Earth & Hell, henceforth shall live in harmony10
<p class="poisontree">Of the Measure, in which
<p class="poisontree">the following Poem is written
<p class="poisontree">We who dwell on Earth can do nothing of ourselves, every thing is conducted by Spirits, no less than Digestion or Sleep. [ to Note the last words of Jesus,

<p class="poisontree">Greek text
<p class="poisontree">When this Verse was first dictated to me I consider'd a Monotonous Cadence like that used by Milton & Shakspeare & all writers of English Blank Verse, derived from the modern bondage of Rhyming; to be a necessary and indispensible part of Verse. But I soon found that

 
in the mouth of a true Orator such monotony was not only awkward, but as much a bondage as rhyme itself. I therefore have produced a variety in every line, both of cadences & number of syllables. Every word and every letter is studied and put into its fit place: the terrific numbers are reserved for the terrific partsâ€”the mild & gentle, for the mild & gentle parts, and the prosaic, for inferior parts: all are necessary to each other. Poetry Fetter'd, Fetters the Human Race! Nations are Destroy'd, or Flourish, in proportion as Their Poetry Painting and Music, are Destroy'd or Flourish! The Primeval State of Man, was Wisdom, Art, and Science.
