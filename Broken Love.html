                Broken Love is a tale of a dark twisted love. It starts on a note of deep-felt regret of an unsuccessful lover. It goes on to portray the angst and the pain felt by the narrator. The opening lines “My spectre around me night and day/ Like a wild beast guards my way” implies that the narrator has lost his zest for life and is now merely a ghost living in a shell (his body). It also illustrates the guilt he feels upon his lover’s death. This guilt that he bears haunts him like a ghost every night and day. This guilt is the result of the sin that he committed. These lines create a tense environment arousing a feeling of apprehension in the reader’s mind.
