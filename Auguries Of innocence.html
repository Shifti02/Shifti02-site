                ‘Auguries of Innocence’ might be regarded as a sort of verse manifesto for much of Blake’s writing, laying out, through a long sequence of examples, his moral position. Blake was consistent in speaking out against injustice and moral wrong, and ‘Auguries of Innocence’ shines further light on how Blake saw evil deeds harming not just the victim but also the perpetrator.
