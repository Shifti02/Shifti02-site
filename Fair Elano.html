                In William Blake's haunting and macabre poem, "Fair Elanor," the reader is taken on a chilling journey through the depths of grief and despair. The poem begins with the tolling of a bell, a somber symbol of death, reverberating through the silent tower. This sets the tone for the rest of the poem, which is characterized by a sense of overwhelming dread and sorrow.

Elanor, the protagonist of the poem, is introduced as a grieving widow, wandering the halls of her castle in a state of despair. The poem vividly captures her emotional state through the use of sensorial language. She hears "hollow rumblings" and feels a "cold stone" beneath her feet, evoking a sense of isolation and emptiness.

As Elanor's grief intensifies, she begins to hallucinate, encountering gruesome visions of bones, skulls, and "pale sickly ghosts." These hallucinations represent her increasing detachment from reality as she descends into a state of madness. The poem reaches its climax when Elanor encounters a mysterious figure who hands her a "wet napkin" and tells her to take it to the "wretched Elenor." This act of betrayal and violence serves as a catalyst for Elanor's complete breakdown.

In the poem's final stanza, Elanor, now completely unhinged, embraces her husband's severed head, her last remnant of him. The poem ends with a sense of profound sorrow and desolation, as Elanor's grief consumes her entirely.

        <p> The bell struck one, and shook the silent tower;
<p>The graves give up their dead: fair Elenor
<p>Walk'd by the castle gate, and lookèd in.
<p>A hollow groan ran thro' the dreary vaults.
<p>She shriek'd aloud, and sunk upon the steps,
<p>On the cold stone her pale cheeks. Sickly smells
<p>Of death issue as from a sepulchre,
<p>And all is silent but the sighing vaults.

<p>Chill Death withdraws his hand, and she revives;
<p>Amaz'd, she finds herself upon her feet,
<p>And, like a ghost, thro' narrow passages
<p>Walking, feeling the cold walls with her hands.

<p>Fancy returns, and now she thinks of bones
<p>And grinning skulls, and corruptible death
<p>Wrapp'd in his shroud; and now fancies she hears
<p>Deep sighs, and sees pale sickly ghosts gliding.

<p>At length, no fancy but reality
<p>Distracts her. A rushing sound, and the feet
<p>Of one that fled, approaches--Ellen stood
<p>Like a dumb statue, froze to stone with fear.

<p>The wretch approaches, crying: `The deed is done;
<p>Take this, and send it by whom thou wilt send;
<p>It is my life--send it to Elenor:--
<p>He's dead, and howling after me for blood!

<p>`Take this,' he cried; and thrust into her arms
<p>A wet napkin, wrapp'd about; then rush'd
<p>Past, howling: she receiv'd into her arms
<p>Pale death, and follow'd on the wings of fear.

<p>They pass'd swift thro' the outer gate; the wretch,
<p>Howling, leap'd o'er the wall into the moat,
<p>Stifling in mud. Fair Ellen pass'd the bridge,
<p>And heard a gloomy voice cry `Is it done?'

<p>As the deer wounded, Ellen flew over
<p>The pathless plain; as the arrows that fly
<p>By night, destruction flies, and strikes in darkness.
<p>She fled from fear, till at her house arriv'd.

<p>Her maids await her; on her bed she falls,
<p>That bed of joy, where erst her lord hath press'd:
<p>`Ah, woman's fear!' she cried; `ah, cursèd duke!
<p>Ah, my dear lord! ah, wretched Elenor!

<p>`My lord was like a flower upon the brows
<p>Of lusty May! Ah, life as frail as flower!
<p>O ghastly death! withdraw thy cruel hand,
<p>Seek'st thou that flow'r to deck thy horrid temples?

<p>`My lord was like a star in highest heav'n
<p>Drawn down to earth by spells and wickedness;
<p>My lord was like the opening eyes of day
<p>When western winds creep softly o'er the flowers;

<p>`But he is darken'd; like the summer's noon
<p>Clouded; fall'n like the stately tree, cut down;
<p>The breath of heaven dwelt among his leaves.
<p>O Elenor, weak woman, fill'd with woe!'

<p>Thus having spoke, she raisèd up her head,
<p>And saw the bloody napkin by her side,
<p>Which in her arms she brought; and now, tenfold
<p>More terrifièd, saw it unfold itself.

<p>Her eyes were fix'd; the bloody cloth unfolds,
<p>Disclosing to her sight the murder'd head
<p>Of her dear lord, all ghastly pale, clotted
<p>With gory blood; it groan'd, and thus it spake:

<p>`O Elenor, I am thy husband's head,
<p>Who, sleeping on the stones of yonder tower,
<p>Was 'reft of life by the accursèd duke!
<p>A hirèd villain turn'd my sleep to death!

<p>`O Elenor, beware the cursèd duke;
<p>O give not him thy hand, now I am dead;
<p>He seeks thy love; who, coward, in the night,
<p>Hirèd a villain to bereave my life.'

<p>She sat with dead cold limbs, stiffen'd to stone;
<p>She took the gory head up in her arms;
<p>She kiss'd the pale lips; she had no tears to shed;
<p>She hugg'd it to her breast, and groan'd her last.
