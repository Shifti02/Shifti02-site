                    The speaker of this song is a mother who sings these rhymes to her son who is going to sleep in the cradle. The mother is singing this song in her tunes to keep her son staying asleep. She is signing these verses in an exclamatory tone, saying that her baby has a sweet smile that makes angles hover over him. This continues for the entire night until she hears the sweet sighs and moans of her child and sees Jesus in her face, at which she recalls the Maker, or God. She is of the view that her child is peaceful, which means the whole creation is peaceful and sleeping. Yet, she sees how Jesus is the Savior of the world and that His smiles are the smiles of the infants, adding this is how heaven and earth keep peace on this earth.
