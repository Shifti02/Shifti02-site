                The poem presents a violent and chaotic battle between Gwin, King of Norway, and Gordred the giant. The imagery is graphic and gruesome, with descriptions of slaughter, gore, and death.

        <div class="poisontreedi" style="margin-left: 5rem;">
        <p> Come, kings, and listen to my song:
<p>When Gwin, the son of Nore,
<p>Over the nations of the North
<p>His cruel sceptre bore;
<p>The nobles of the land did feed
<p>Upon the hungry poor;
<p>They tear the poor man's lamb, and drive
<p>The needy from their door.

<p>`The land is desolate; our wives
<p>And children cry for bread;
<p>Arise, and pull the tyrant down!
<p>Let Gwin be humblèd!'

<p>Gordred the giant rous'd himself
<p>From sleeping in his cave;
<p>He shook the hills, and in the clouds
<p>The troubl'd banners wave.

<p>Beneath them roll'd, like tempests black,
<p>The num'rous sons of blood;
<p>Like lions' whelps, roaring abroad,
<p>Seeking their nightly food.

<p>Down Bleron's hills they dreadful rush,
<p>Their cry ascends the clouds;
<p>The trampling horse and clanging arms
<p>Like rushing mighty floods!

<p>Their wives and children, weeping loud,
<p>Follow in wild array,
<p>Howling like ghosts, furious as wolves
<p>In the bleak wintry day.

<p>`Pull down the tyrant to the dust,
<p>Let Gwin be humblèd,'
<p>They cry, `and let ten thousand lives
<p>Pay for the tyrant's head.'

<p>From tow'r to tow'r the watchmen cry,
<p>`O Gwin, the son of Nore,
<p>Arouse thyself! the nations, black
<p>Like clouds, come rolling o'er!'

<p>Gwin rear'd his shield, his palace shakes,
<p>His chiefs come rushing round;
<p>Each, like an awful thunder cloud,
<p>With voice of solemn sound:

<p>Like rearèd stones around a grave
<p>They stand around the King;
<p>Then suddenly each seiz'd his spear,
<p>And clashing steel does ring.

<p>The husbandman does leave his plough
<p>To wade thro' fields of gore;
<p>The merchant binds his brows in steel,
<p>And leaves the trading shore;

<p>The shepherd leaves his mellow pipe,
<p>And sounds the trumpet shrill;
<p>The workman throws his hammer down
<p>To heave the bloody bill.

<p>Like the tall ghost of Barraton
<p>Who sports in stormy sky,
<p>Gwin leads his host, as black as night
<p>When pestilence does fly,

<p>With horses and with chariots--
<p>And all his spearmen b 1000 old
<p>March to the sound of mournful song,
<p>Like clouds around him roll'd.

<p>Gwin lifts his hand--the nations halt;
<p>`Prepare for war!' he cries--
<p>Gordred appears!--his frowning brow
<p>Troubles our northern skies.

<p>The armies stand, like balances
<p>Held in th' Almighty's hand;--
<p>`Gwin, thou hast fill'd thy measure up:
<p>Thou'rt swept from out the land.'

<p>And now the raging armies rush'd
<p>Like warring mighty seas;
<p>The heav'ns are shook with roaring war,
<p>The dust ascends the skies!

<p>Earth smokes with blood, and groans and shakes
<p>To drink her children's gore,
<p>A sea of blood; nor can the eye
<p>See to the trembling shore!

<p>And on the verge of this wild sea
<p>Famine and death doth cry;
<p>The cries of women and of babes
<p>Over the field doth fly.

<p>The King is seen raging afar,
<p>With all his men of might;
<p>Like blazing comets scattering death
<p>Thro' the red fev'rous night.

<p>Beneath his arm like sheep they die,
<p>And groan upon the plain;
<p>The battle faints, and bloody men
<p>Fight upon hills of slain.

<p>Now death is sick, and riven men
<p>Labour and toil for life;
<p>Steed rolls on steed, and shield on shield,
<p>Sunk in this sea of strife!

<p>The god of war is drunk with blood;
<p>The earth doth faint and fail;
<p>The stench of blood makes sick the heav'ns;
<p>Ghosts glut the throat of hell!

<p>O what have kings to answer for
<p>Before that awful throne;
<p>When thousand deaths for vengeance cry,
<p>And ghosts accusing groan!

<p>Like blazing comets in the sky
<p>That shake the stars of light,
<p>Which drop like fruit unto the earth
<p>Thro' the fierce burning night;

<p>Like these did Gwin and Gordred meet,
<p>And the first blow decides;
<p>Down from the brow unto the breast
<p>Gordred his head divides!

<p>Gwin fell: the sons of Norway fled,
<p>All that remain'd alive;
<p>The rest did fill the vale of death,
<p>For them the eagles strive.

<p>The river Dorman roll'd their blood
<p>Into the northern sea;
<p>Who mourn'd his sons, and overwhelm'd
<p>The pleasant south country.
