                The Spectre is Blake’s term for the isolate Selfhood, the ‘spirit’ of Solipsism.  Blake eludes towards the idea that we are isolated from our intimate brides, Emanation, the total form of what any human being creates and loves. The Spectre guards us, like a menace keeping everything from the Self. The Emanation at first has failed to emanate, and keeps far within the pscyhe, weeping for a sin which is the Self’s failure to create and love. Throughout the lyric, the speaker is trapped in what Blake calls the state of ultimate error, or single vision, the world of egomania. The flight or pursuit to and from the embrace of what Emanation eludes to offer fails.
