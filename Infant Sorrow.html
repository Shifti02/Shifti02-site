                ‘Infant Joy’, the earlier counterpart to this poem, is noteworthy for being spoken by both the newborn baby and its mother: ‘I am but two days old’, speaks the joyous infant, while another voice – as we learn from the second stanza, the voice of the infant’s mother – responds with the question, ‘What shall I call thee?’

‘Infant Sorrow’ is quite different. In summary, a baby tells us about its birth: its mother groaned with the pain of childbirth, but its father also wept, possibly because the father knew the full horrors of the world the infant was being born into. Indeed, the infant tells us that the world it was born into was dangerous.

But the infant, too, contains a hint of menace, being like a ‘fiend hid in a cloud’. The unexpected simile here is striking: angels go on clouds, not fiends, and newborn infants are associated with angelic innocence rather than fiendish possession.

        My mother groaned, my father wept,
        <p>Into the dangerous world I leapt;
            <p>Helpless, naked, piping loud,
                <p>Like a fiend hid in a cloud.

                    <p>Struggling in my father's hands,
                        <p>Striving against my swaddling bands,
                            <p>Bound and weary, I thought best
                                <p>To sulk upon my mother's breast.
