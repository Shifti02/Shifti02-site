                'The Little Boy Found' is to be read along with 'The Little Boy Lost'. Here, God readily responds to the child's agony and restores him to his mother. With this the Songs of Innocence culminates and Blake goes to the next aspect of human life, namely Experience.



      If in 'The Little Boy Lost' we discover the negation of paternal feeling, in 'The Little Boy Found' we have a thriving picture of a father who remains as a full-fledged redeemer extending his hands towards the ailing. The boy lost in the fen weeps and God carries out the rescue operation. He appears in white dress before the child and like a loving father takes his hand and brings him to his mother. To put it in a different way we may opine that innocence 'lost' in the marshy land is 'rescued' and restored. It is not merely the child who is pacified.

        The little boy lost in the lonely fen,
<p>Led by the wandering light,
    <p>Began to cry, but God, ever nigh,
        <p>Appeared like his father, in white.

            <p>He kissed the child, and by the hand led,
                <p>And to his mother brought,
                    <p>Who in sorrow pale, through the lonely dale,
                        <p>The little boy weeping sought.
