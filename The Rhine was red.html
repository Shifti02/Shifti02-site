                The poem begins with the striking image of the Rhine being red. This vivid coloration suggests a state of blood or violence, evoking themes of conflict, upheaval, or revolutionary fervor.
The redness of the Rhine may symbolize the tumultuous and transformative nature of historical events, or it could represent the poet's visionary perception of reality. The poem was written during a period of political and social upheaval in Europe, marked by revolutions, wars, and the rise of industrialization. Blake, a keen observer of his times, may have been commenting on these tumultuous events through his poetic imagery.
The redness of the Rhine could be interpreted as a reflection of the bloodshed and turmoil of contemporary society.

        <p class="poisontree">The Rhine was red with humane blood,
<p class="poisontree">The Danube roll'd a purple tide,
<p class="poisontree">On the Euphrates Satan stood
<p class="poisontree">And over Asia stretch'd his pride.

<p class="poisontree">He wither'd up sweet Zion's Hill
<p class="poisontree">From every Nation of the Earth;
<p class="poisontree">He wither'd up Jerusalem's Gates
<p class="poisontree">And in a dark Land gave her birth.

<p class="poisontree">He wither'd up the Human Form
<p class="poisontree">By laws of sacrifice for sin,
<p class="poisontree">Till it became a Mortal Worm,
<p class="poisontree">But O! translucent all within.

<p class="poisontree">Spectre of Albion! warlike Fiend!
<p class="poisontree">In clouds of blood and ruin roll'd,
<p class="poisontree">I here reclaim thee as my own,
<p class="poisontree">My Selfhood! Satan! arm'd in gold.

<p class="poisontree">Is this thy soft Family-Love,
<p class="poisontree">Thy cruel Patriarchal pride,
<p class="poisontree">Planting the Family alone,
<p class="poisontree">Destroying all the World beside?

<p class="poisontree">A man's worst enemies are those
<p class="poisontree">Of his own house and family;
<p class="poisontree">And he who makes his law a curse,
<p class="poisontree">By his own law shall surely die.

<p class="poisontree">In my Exchanges every Land,
<p class="poisontree">Shall walk, and mine in every Land,
<p class="poisontree">Mutual shall build Jerusalem,
<p class="poisontree">Both heart in heart and hand in hand.
