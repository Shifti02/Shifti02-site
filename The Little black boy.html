                Blake’s “The Little Black Boy” appears, on face, to be a kindly demonstration of how race doesn’t really matter since one day all    Christians will be free from the “cloud” of skin color and equal in the eyes of God.

        <div class="poisontreedi" style="margin-left: 5rem;">
        My mother bore me in the southern wild,
<p>And I am black, but oh my soul is white!
    <p>White as an angel is the English child,
        <p>But I am black, as if bereaved of light.

            <p>My mother taught me underneath a tree,
                <p>And, sitting down before the heat of day,
                    <p>She took me on her lap and kissed me,
                        <p>And, pointed to the east, began to say:

                            <p>'Look on the rising sun: there God does live,
                                <p>And gives His light, and gives His heat away,
                                    <p>And flowers and trees and beasts and men receive
                                        <p>Comfort in morning, joy in the noonday.

                                            <p>'And we are put on earth a little space,
                                                <p>That we may learn to bear the beams of love
                                                    <p>And these black bodies and this sunburnt face
                                                        <p>Is but a cloud, and like a shady grove.

                                                            <p>'For when our souls have learn'd the heat to bear,
                                                                <p>The cloud will vanish, we shall hear His voice,
                                                                    <p>Saying, 'Come out from the grove, my love and care
                                                                        <p>And round my golden tent like lambs rejoice','

                                                                            <p>Thus did my mother say, and kissed me;
                                                                                <p>And thus I say to little English boy.
                                                                                    <p>When I from black and he from white cloud free,
                                                                                        <p>And round the tent of God like lambs we joy

                                                                                            <p>I'll shade him from the heat till he can bear
                                                                                                <p>To lean in joy upon our Father's knee;
                                                                                                    <p>And then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair,
                                                                                                        <p>And be like him, and he will then love me.
