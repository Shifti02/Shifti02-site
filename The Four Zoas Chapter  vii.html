                Los, representing the creative and prophetic aspects of human imagination, faces Orc, who symbolizes revolutionary energy and unrestrained passion. Their conflict is central to the chapter and epitomizes the tension between controlled creativity and chaotic revolution. Los binds Orc with chains, attempting to contain the destructive power that Orc represents.Urizen, who embodies reason and law, undergoes a significant transformation in this chapter. His journey is marked by moments of self-realization and despair as he confronts the consequences of his rigid, authoritarian rule. Urizen’s encounters with the monstrous forms of his own creation and the desolate landscapes he traverses symbolize his inner turmoil and the collapse of his ordered world.Enitharmon, Los's feminine counterpart, and Vala, representing nature and sensuality, play crucial roles in this chapter. Enitharmon’s actions and dreams reflect the generative and nurturing aspects of imagination, while Vala’s interactions with the other characters symbolize the allure and danger of natural instincts and desires.Blake introduces a vision of the Divine Humanity, a concept representing the unity and redemption of the fragmented aspects of human existence. This vision contrasts sharply with the chaos and conflict pervading the narrative, offering a glimpse of hope and the possibility of reconciliation.

Revolving round in whirlpools fierce all round the cavernd worlds
But Urizen silent descended to the Caves of Orc & saw t 
A Cavernd Universe of flaming fire the horses of Urizen

Striking fierce sparkles from their brazen fetters. fierce his lions t
Howl in the burning dens his tygers roam ill the redounding smoke
In forests of affliction. the adamantine scales of justice 0
Consuming in the raging lamps of mercy pourd in rivers

Of goary blood the immortal seed is nourishd for the slaughter 
The bulls of Luvah breathing fire bellow on burning pastures
Round howling Orc whose awful limbs cast forth red smoke & fire
That Urizen approachd not near but took his seat on a rock
And rangd his books around him brooding Envious over Orc t
Howling & rending his dark caves the awful Demon lay 0
Pulse after pulse beat on his fetters pulse after pulse his spirit
Darted & darted higher & higher to the shrine of Enitharmon
As when the thunder folds himself in thickest clouds
The watry nations couch & hide in the profoundest deeps
Then bursting from his troubled head with terrible visages & flaming hair 
His swift wingd daughters sweep across the vast black ocean
Los felt the Envy in his limbs like to a blighted tree

His book of iron on his knees he tracd the dreadful letters
While his snows fell & his storms beat to cool the flames of Orc
Age after Age till underneath his heel a deadly root
Struck thro the rock the root of Mystery accursed shooting up 
Branches into the heaven of Los they pipe formd bending down
Take root again whereever they touch again branching forth
In intricate labyrinths oerspreading many a grizly deep
Amazd started Urizen when he found himself compassd round

Stood so thick he with difficulty & great pain brought
His books out of the dismal shade. all but the book of iron
Again he took his seat & rangd his Books around t
On a rock of iron frowning over the foaming fires of Orc
And Urizen hung over Ore & viewd his terrible wrath15
Sitting upon an iron Crag at length his words broke forth t
Image of dread whence art thou whence is this most woful place
Whence these fierce fires but from thyself No other living thing
In all this Chasm I behold. No other living thing
Dare thy most terrible wrath abide Bound here to waste in pain 0 
Thy vital substance in these fires that issue new & new
Around thee sometimes like a flood & sometimes like a rock
Of living pangs thy horrible bed glowing with ceaseless fires
Beneath thee & around Above a Shower of fire now beats
Moulded to globes & arrowy wedges rending thy bleeding limbs 
And now a whirling pillar of burning sands to overwhelm thee
Steeping thy wounds in salts infernal & in bitter anguish
And now a rock moves on the surface of this lake of fire
To bear thee down beneath the waves in stifling despair
Pity for thee movd me to break my dark & long repose 0
And to reveal myself before thee in a form of wisdom
Yet thou dost laugh at all these tortures & this horrible place
Yet throw thy limbs these fires abroad that back return upon thee
While thou reposest throwing rage on rage feeding thyself
With visions of sweet bliss far other than this burning clime 
Sure thou art bathd in rivers of delight on verdant fields
Walking in joy in bright Expanses sleeping on bright clouds
With visions of delight so lovely that they urge thy rage
Tenfold with fierce desire to rend thy chain & howl in fury
And dim oblivion of all woe & desperate repose 0
Or is thy joy founded on torment which others bear for thee
Orc answer'd Curse thy hoary brows. What dost thou in this deep
Thy Pity I contemn scatter thy snows elsewhere

Sweeps over thee freezing to solid still thou sitst closd up 
In that transparent rock as if in joy of thy bright prison
Till overburdend with its own weight drawn out thro immensity

Thundring & hail & frozen iron haild from the Element
Rends thy white hair yet thou dost fixd obdurate brooding sit 0
Writing thy books. Anon a cloud filld with a waste of snows
Covers thee still obdurate still resolvd & writing still
Tho rocks roll oer thee tho floods pour tho winds black as the Sea t
Cut thee in gashes tho the blood pours down around thy ankles
Freezing thy feet to the hard rock still thy pen obdurate 
Traces the wonders of Futurity in horrible fear of the future
I rage furious in the deep for lo my feet & hands are naild
To the hard rock or thou shouldst feel my enmity & hate
In all the diseases of man falling upon thy grey accursed front 
Urizen answerd Read my books explore my Constellations 0
Enquire of my Sons & they shall teach thee how to War
Enquire of my Daughters who accursd in the dark depths
Knead bread of Sorrow by my stern command for I am God
Of all this dreadful ruin Rise O daughters at my Stern command
Rending the Rocks Eleth & Uveth rose & Ona rose 
Terrific with their iron vessels driving them across
In the dim air they took the book of iron & placd above
On clouds of death & sang their songs Kneading the bread of Orc
Orc listend to the song compelld hungring on the cold wind
That swaggd heavy with the accursed dough. the hoar frost ragd 0
Thro Onas sieve the torrent rain pourd from the iron pail
Of Eleth & the icy hands of Uveth kneaded the bread
The heavens bow with terror underneath their iron hands
Singing at their dire work the words of Urizens book of iron
While the enormous scrolls rolld dreadful in the heavens above 
And still the burden of their song in tears was poured forth
The bread is Kneaded let us rest O cruel father of children
But Urizen remitted not their labours upon his rock

Listen O Daughters to my voice Listen to the Words of Wisdom
So shall govern over all let Moral Duty tune your tongue t
But be your hearts harder than the nether millstone
To bring the shadow of Enitharmon beneath our wondrous tree 
That Los may Evaporate like smoke & be no more
Draw down Enitharmon to the Spectre of Urthona
And let him have dominion over Los the terrible shade
Compell the poor to live upon a Crust of bread by soft mild arts
Smile when they frown frown when they smile & when a man looks pale 0
With labour & abstinence say he looks healthy & happy
And when his children Sicken let them die there are enough
Born even too many & our Earth will be overrun
Without these arts If you would make the poor live with temper
With pomp give every crust of bread you give with gracious cunning 
Magnify small gifts reduce the man to want a gift & then give with pomp t
Say he smiles if you hear him sigh If pale say he is ruddy
Preach temperance say he is overgorgd & drowns his wit
In strong drink tho you know that bread & water are all
He can afford Flatter his wife pity his children till we can 0
Reduce all to our will as spaniels are taught with art 
Lo how the heart & brain are formed in the breeding womb
Of Enitharmon how it buds with life & forms the bones
The little heart the liver & the red blood in its labyrinths
By gratified desire by strong devouring appetite she fills 
Los with ambitious fury that his race shall all devour
Then Orc cried Curse thy Cold hypocrisy. already round thy Tree t
In scales that shine with gold & rubies thou beginnest to weaken
My divided Spirit Like a worm I rise in peace unbound
From wrath Now When I rage my fetters bind me more 0
O torment O torment A Worm compelld. Am I a worm
Is it in strong deceit that man is born. In strong deceit
Thou dost restrain my fury that the worm may fold the tree
Avaunt Cold hypocrite I am chaind or thou couldst not use me thus
The Man shall rage bound with this Chain the worm in silence creep 
Thou wilt not cease from rage Grey Demon silence all thy storms
Give me example of thy mildness King of furious hail storms
Art thou the cold attractive power that holds me in this chain
I well remember how I stole thy light & it became fire
Consuming. Thou Knowst me now O Urizen Prince of Light 0
And I know thee is this the triumph this the Godlike State
That lies beyond the bounds of Science in the Grey obscure
Terrified Urizen heard Orc now certain that he was Luvah t
And Orc began to Organize a Serpent body
Despising Urizens light & turning it into flaming fire 
Recieving as a poisond Cup Recieves the heavenly wine
And turning affection into fury & thought into abstraction t
A Self consuming dark devourer rising into the heavens
Urizen envious brooding sat & saw the secret terror
Flame high in pride & laugh to scorn the source of his deceit 0
Nor knew the source of his own but thought himself the Sole author
<p class="poisontree">[ PAGE81 ]
<p class="poisontree">Of all his wandering Experiments in the horrible Abyss
He knew that weakness stretches out in breadth & length he knew
That wisdom reaches high & deep & therefore he made Orc
In Serpent form compelld stretch out & up the mysterious tree
He sufferd him to Climb that he might draw all human forms 
Into submission to his will nor knew the dread result
Los sat in showers of Urizen watching cold Enitharmon t
His broodings rush down to his feet producing Eggs that hatching
Burst forth upon the winds above the tree of Mystery
Enitharmon lay on his knees. Urizen tracd his Verses 0
In the dark deep the dark tree grew. her shadow was drawn down
Down to the roots it wept over Orc. the Shadow of Enitharmon 
Los saw her stretchd the image of death upon his witherd valleys
Her Shadow went forth & returnd Now she was pale as Snow
When the mountains & hills are coverd over & the paths of Men shut up t 
But when her spirit returnd as ruddy as a morning when
The ripe fruit blushes into joy in heavens eternal halls t
Sorrow shot thro him from his feet it shot up to his head
Like a cold night that nips the root & shatters off the leaves t
Silent he stood oer Enitharmon watching her pale face 0
He spoke not he was Silent till he felt the cold disease
Then Los mournd on the dismal wind in his jealous lamentation
Why can I not Enjoy thy beauty Lovely Enitharmon
When I return from clouds of Grief in the wandring Elements
Where thou in thrilling joy in beaming summer loveliness 
Delectable reposest ruddy in my absence flaming with beauty
Cold pale in sorrow at my approach trembling at my terrific
Forehead & eyes thy lips decay like roses in the spring t
How art thou Shrunk thy grapes that burst in summers vast Excess
Shut up in little purple covering faintly bud & die 0
Thy olive trees that pourd down oil upon a thousand hills
Sickly look forth & scarcely stretch their branches to the plain
Thy roses that expanded in the face of glowing morn
<p class="poisontree">[ PAGE82 ]
<p class="poisontree">Hid in a little silken veil scarce breathe & faintly shine
Thy lilies that gave light what time the morning looked forth
Hid in the Vales faintly lament & no one hears their voice
All things beside the woful Los enjoy the delights of beauty
Once how I sang & calld the beasts & birds to their delights 
Nor knew that I alone exempted from the joys of love
Must war with secret monsters of the animating worlds
O that I had not seen the day then should I be at rest
Nor felt the stingings of desire nor longings after life
For life is Sweet to Los the wretched to his winged woes 0
Is given a craving cry that they may sit at night on barren rocks
And whet their beaks & snuff the air & watch the opening dawn
And Shriek till at the smells of blood they stretch their boney wings
And cut the winds like arrows shot by troops of Destiny
Thus Los lamented in the night unheard by Enitharmon 
For the Shadow of Enitharmon descended down the tree of Mystery
The Spectre saw the Shade Shivering over his gloomy rocks
Beneath the tree of Mystery which in the dismal Abyss
Began to blossom in fierce pain shooting its writhing buds
In throes of birth & now the blossoms falling shining fruit 0 
Appeard of many colours & of various poisonous qualities
Of Plagues hidden in shining globes that grew on the living tree
The Spectre of Urthona saw the Shadow of Enitharmon
Beneath the Tree of Mystery among the leaves & fruit t
Reddning the Demon strong prepard the poison of sweet Love 
He turnd from side to side in tears he wept & he embracd t
The fleeting image & in whispers mild wood the faint shade
Loveliest delight of Men. Enitharmon shady hiding
In secret places where no eye can trace thy watry way

Because of Orc because he rent his discordant way
From thy sweet loins of bliss. red flowd thy blood
Pale grew thy face lightnings playd around thee thunders hoverd t
Over thee, & the terrible Orc rent his discordant way t
But the next joy of thine shall be in sweet delusion

And the Harlot of Los & the deluded harlot of the Kings of Earth1 
His soul was gnawn in sunder
The hairy shoulders rend the links free are the wrists of fire
Red rage redounds he rouzd his lions from his forests black
They howl around the flaming youth rending the nameless shadow
And running their immortal course thro solid darkness borne 0 
Loud sounds the war song round red Orc in his [? triumphant ]fury t
And round the nameless shadowy Female in her howling terror
When all the Elemental Gods joind in the wondrous Song
Sound the War trumpet terrific Souls clad in attractive steel
Sound the shrill fife serpents of war. I hear the northern drum2 
Awake, I hear the flappings of the folding banners
The dragons of the North put on their armour
Upon the Eastern sea direct they take their course
The glittring of their horses trapping stains the vault of night
Stop we the rising of the glorious King. spur spur your clouds t 0

The northern drum. Now give the charge! bravely obscurd!
With darts of wintry hail. Again the black bow draw
Again the Elemental Strings to your right breasts draw
And let the thundring drum speed on the arrows black 
The arrows flew from cloudy bow all day. till blood
From east to west flowd like the human veins in rivers
Of life upon the plains of death & valleys of despair
Now sound the clarions of Victory now strip the slain
clothe yourselves in golden arms brothers of war t 0
They sound the clarions strong they chain the howling captives
they give the Oath of blood They cast the lots into the helmet, t
They vote the death of Luvah & they naild him to the tree
They piercd him with a spear & laid him in a sepulcher
To die a death of Six thousand years bound round with desolation1 
The sun was black & the moon rolld a useless globe thro heaven
Then left the Sons of Urizen the plow & harrow the loom
The hammer & the Chisel & the rule & compasses
They forgd the sword the chariot of war the battle ax
The trumpet fitted to the battle & the flute of summer 0
And all the arts of life they changd into the arts of death
The hour glass contemnd because its simple workmanship
Was as the workmanship of the plowman & the water wheel
That raises water into Cisterns broken & burnd in fire
Because its workmanship was like the workmanship of the Shepherd2 
And in their stead intricate wheels invented Wheel without wheel
To perplex youth in their outgoings & to bind to labours
Of day & night the myriads of Eternity. that they might file
And polish brass & iron hour after hour laborious workmanship
Kept ignorant of the use that they might spend the days of wisdom 0
In sorrowful drudgery to obtain a scanty pittance of bread
In ignorance to view a small portion & think that All
And call it Demonstration blind to all the simple rules of life 
Now now the Battle rages round thy tender limbs O Vala
Now smile among thy bitter tears now put on all thy beauty 
Is not the wound of the sword Sweet & the broken bone delightful
Wilt thou now smile among the slain when the wounded groan in the field

<p class="poisontree">Life up thy blue eyes Vala & put on thy sapphire shoes
O Melancholy Magdalen behold the morning breaks
Gird on thy flaming Zone. descend into the Sepulcher
Scatter the blood from thy golden brow the tears from thy silver locks
Shake off the waters from thy wings & the dust from thy white garments 
Remember all thy feigned terrors on the secret Couch
When the sun rose in glowing morn with arms of mighty hosts
Marching to battle who was wont to rise with Urizens harps t
Girt as a Sower with his seed to scatter life abroad
Arise O Vala bring the bow of Urizen bring the swift arrows of light 0
How ragd the golden horses of Urizen bound to the chariot of Love
Compelld to leave the plow to the Ox to snuff up the winds of desolation
To trample the corn fields in boastful neighings. this is no gentle harp
This is no warbling brook nor Shadow of a Myrtle tree
But blood & wounds & dismal cries & clarions of war1 
And hearts laid open to the light by the broad grizly sword
And bowels hidden in hammerd steel rippd forth upon the Ground t
Call forth thy Smiles of soft deceit call forth thy cloudy tears
We hear thy sighs in trumpets shrill when Morn shall blood renew t
So sung the demons of the deep the Clarions of war blew loud 0
Orc rent her & his human form consumd in his own fires
Mingled with her dolorous members strewn thro the Abyss
She joyd in all the Conflict Gratified & drinking tears of woe
No more remaind of Orc but the Serpent round the tree of Mystery
The form of Orc was gone he reard his serpent bulk among2 
The stars of Urizen in Power rending the form of life t
Into a formless indefinite & strewing her on the Abyss
Like clouds upon the winter sky broken with winds & thunders
This was to her Supreme delight The Warriors mournd disappointed
They go out to war with Strong Shouts & loud Clarions O Pity 0
They return with lamentations mourning & weeping
Invisible or visible drawn out in length or stretchd in breadth
The Shadowy Female varied in the War in her delight
Howling in discontent black & heavy uttering brute sounds
Wading thro fens among the slimy weeds making Lamentations 
To decieve Tharmas in his rage to soothe his furious soul 
To stay him in his flight that Urizen might live tho in pain
He said Art thou bright Enion is the Shadow of hope returnd
And She said Tharmas I am Vala bless thy innocent face
Doth Enion avoid the sight of thy blue watry eyes 0
Be not perswaded that the air knows this or the falling dew
Tharmas replid O Vala once I livd in a garden of delight
<p class="poisontree">[ PAGE94 ]
<p class="poisontree">I wakend Enion in the Morning & she turnd away
Among the apple trees & all the gardens of delight
Swam like a dream before my eyes I went to seek the steps
Of Enion in the gardens & the shadows compassd me
And closd me in a watry world of woe where Enion stood 
Trembling before me like a shadow like a mist like air
And she is gone & here alone I war with darkness & death
I hear thy voice but not thy form see. thou & all delight
And life appear & vanish mocking me with shadows of false hope
Hast thou forgot that the air listens thro all its districts telling 0
The subtlest thoughts shut up from light in chambers of the Moon
Tharmas. The Moon has chambers where the babes of love lie hid
And whence they never can be brought in all Eternity
Unless exposd by their vain parents. Lo him whom I love
Is hidden from me & I never in all Eternity1 
Shall see him Enitharmon & Ahania combind with Enion
Hid him in that Outrageous form of Orc which torments me for Sin t
For all my Secret faults which he brings forth upon the light
Of day in jealousy & blood my Children are led to Urizens war
Before my eyes & for every one of these I am condemnd 0
To Eternal torment in these flames for tho I have the power
To rise on high Yet love here binds me down & never never
Will I arise till him I love is loosd from this dark chain
Tharmas replied Vala thy Sins have lost us heaven & bliss
Thou art our Curse and till I can bring love into the light t2 
I never will depart from my great wrath
So Tharmas waild wrathful then rode upon the Stormy Deep t
Cursing the Voice that mockd him with false hope in furious mood
Then She returns swift as a blight upon the infant bud
Howling in all the notes of woe to stay his furious rage 0
Stamping the hills wading or swimming flying furious or falling
Or like an Earthquake rumbling in the bowels of the earth
Or like a cloud beneath & like a fire flaming in high
Walking in pleasure of the hills or murmuring in the dales
Like to a rushing torrent beneath & a falling rock above 
A thunder cloud in the south & a lulling voice heard in the north 
And she went forth & saw the forms of Life & of delight
Walking on Mountains or flying in the open expanse of heaven
She heard sweet voices in the winds & in the voices of birds
That rose from waters for the waters were as the voice of Luvah 0
Not seen to her like waters or like this dark world of death
Tho all those fair perfections which men know only by name
In beautiful substantial forms appeard & served her
As food or drink or ornament or in delightful works
To build her bowers for the Elements brought forth abundantly 
The living soul in glorious forms & every one came forth
Walking before her Shadowy face & bowing at her feet
But in vain delights were poured forth on the howling melancholy
For her delight the horse his proud neck bowd & his white mane
And the Strong Lion deignd in his mouth to wear the golden bit 0
While the far beaming Peacock waited on the fragrant wind
To bring her fruits of sweet delight from trees of richest wonders
And the strong piniond Eagle bore the fire of heaven in the night season
Wood & subdud into Eternal Death the Demon Lay
In rage against the dark despair. the howling Melancholy t

These words If ye will believe your B other shall rise again
In golden letters ornamented with sweet labours of Love
Waiting with Patience for the fulfilment of the Promise Divine t
And all the Songs of Beulah sounded comfortable notes
Not suffring doubt to rise up from the Clouds of the Shadowy Female 0
Then myriads of the Dead burst thro the bottoms of their tombs
Descending on the shadowy females clouds in Spectrous terror

But then the Spectre enterd Los's bosom Every sigh & groan t

Not as another but as thy real Self I am thy Spectre

For thou art but a form & organ of life & of thyself

Who when convincd can still persist. tho furious.controllable
By Reasons power. Even I already feel a World within
Opening its gates & in it all the real substances
Of which these in the outward World are shadows which pass away
Come then into my Bosom & in thy shadowy arms bring with thee 0
My lovely Enitharmon. I will quell my fury & teach
Peace to the Soul of dark revenge & repentance to Cruelty
So spoke Los & Embracing Enitharmon & the Spectre
Clouds would have folded round in Extacy & Love uniting
<p class="poisontree">[ PAGE87 ]
<p class="poisontree">But Enitharmon trembling fled & hid beneath Urizens tree
But mingling together with his Spectre the Spectre of Urthona t
Wondering beheld the Center opend by Divine Mercy inspired t
He in his turn Gave Tasks to Los Enormous to destroy t
That body he created but in vain for Los performd Wonders of labour 
They Builded Golgonooza Los labouring builded pillars high t
And Domes terrific in the nether heavens for beneath

Threefold within the brain within the heart within the loins
A Threefold Atmosphere Sublime continuous from Urthonas world t 0
But yet having a Limit Twofold named Satan & Adam 
But Los stood on the Limit of Translucence weeping & trembling
Filled with doubts in self accusation beheld the fruit t
Of Urizens Mysterious tree For Enitharmon thus spake
When In the Deeps beneath I gatherd of this ruddy fruit1 
It was by that I knew that I had Sinnd & then I knew
That without a ransom I could not be savd from Eternal death
That Life lives upon Death & by devouring appetite
All things subsist on one another thenceforth in Despair
I spend my glowing time but thou art strong & mighty 0
To bear this Self conviction take then Eat thou also of
The fruit & give me proof of life Eternal or I die
Then Los plucked the fruit & Eat & sat down in Despair
And must have given himself to death Eternal But
Urthonas spectre in part mingling with him comforted him2 
Being a medium between him & Enitharmon But This Union
Was not to be Effected without Cares & Sorrows & Troubles
Of six thousand Years of self denial and of bitter Contrition t
Urthonas Spectre terrified beheld the Spectres of the Dead
Each Male formd without a counterpart without a concentering vision 0
The Spectre of Urthona wept before Los Saying I am the cause
That this dire state commences I began the dreadful state
Of Separation & on my dark head the curse & punishment
Must fall unless a way be found to Ransom & Redeem t
But I have thee my [ Counterpart Vegetating ]miraculous t 
These Spectres have no [ Counter (parts)]therefore they ravin
Without the food of life Let us Create them Coun
For without a Created body the Spectre is Eternal Death
Los trembling answerd Now I feel the weight of stern repentance
Tremble not so my Enitharmon at the awful gates 0
Of thy poor broken Heart I see thee like a shadow withering
As on the outside of Existence but look! behold! take comfort!
Turn inwardly thine Eyes & there behold the Lamb of God
Clothed in Luvahs robes of blood descending to redeem
O Spectre of Urthona take comfort O Enitharmon 
Couldst thou but cease from terror & trembling & affright
When I appear before thee in forgiveness of ancient injuries t
Why shouldst thou remember & be afraid. I surely have died in pain
Often enough to convince thy jealousy & fear & terror t
Come hither be patient let us converse together because t 0
I also tremble at myself & at all my former life
Enitharmon answerd I behold the Lamb of God descending
To Meet these Spectres of the Dead I therefore fear that he t 
Will give us to Eternal Death fit punishment for such
Hideous offenders Uttermost extinction in eternal pain 
An ever dying life of stifling & obstruction shut out
Of existence to be a sign & terror to all who behold
Lest any should in futurity do as we have done in heaven
Such is our state nor will the Son of God redeem us but destroy
<p class="poisontree">[ PAGE98 [90] ]
<p class="poisontree">So Enitharmon spoke trembling & in torrents of tears
Los sat in Golgonooza in the Gate of Luban where t
He had erected many porches where branchd the Mysterious Tree t
Where the Spectrous dead wail & sighing thus he spoke to Enitharmon
Lovely delight of Men Enitharmon shady refuge from furious war t 
Thy bosom translucent is a soft repose for the weeping souls
Of those piteous victims of battle there they sleep in happy obscurity
They feed upon our life we are their victims. Stern desire
I feel to fabricate embodied semblances in which the dead
May live before us in our palaces & in our gardens of labour t 0
Which now opend within the Center we behold spread abroad
To form a world of Sacrifice of brothers & sons & daughters t
To comfort Orc in his dire sufferings look my fires enlume afresh
Before my face ascending with delight as in ancient times
Enitharmon spread her beaming locks upon the wind & said1 
O Lovely terrible Los wonder of Eternity O Los my defence & guide t
Thy works are all my joy. & in thy fires my soul delights
If mild they burn in just proportion & in secret night
And silence build their day in shadow of soft clouds & dews
Then I can sigh forth on the winds of Golgonooza piteous forms 0
That vanish again into my bosom but if thou my Los
Wilt in sweet moderated fury. fabricate forms sublime t
Such as the piteous spectres may assimilate themselves into
They shall be ransoms for our Souls that we may live
So Enitharmon spoke & Los his hands divine inspired began t2 
To modulate his fires studious the loud roaring flames
He vanquishd with the strength of Art bending their iron points
And drawing them forth delighted upon the winds of Golgonooza t
From out the ranks of Urizens war & from the fiery lake
Of Orc bending down as the binder of the Sheaves follows 0
The reaper in both arms embracing the furious raging flames
Los drew them forth out of the deeps planting his right foot firm
Upon the Iron crag of Urizen thence springing up aloft
Into the heavens of Enitharmon in a mighty circle
And first he drew a line upon the walls of shining heaven 
And Enitharmon tincturd it with beams of blushing love 
It remaind permanent a lovely form inspird divinely human
Dividing into just proportions Los unwearied labourd
The immortal lines upon the heavens till with sighs of love
Sweet Enitharmon mild Entrancd breathd forth upon the wind 0
The spectrous dead Weeping the Spectres viewd the immortal works
Of Los Assimilating to those forms Embodied & Lovely
In youth & beauty in the arms of Enitharmon mild reposing
First Rintrah & then Palamabron drawn from out the ranks of war
In infant innocence reposd on Enitharmons bosom 
Orc was comforted in the deeps his soul revivd in them
As the Eldest brother is the fathers image So Orc became t
As Los a father to his brethren & he joyd in the dark lake
Tho bound with chains of Jealousy & in scales of iron & brass
But Los loved them & refusd to Sacrifice their infant limbs 0
And Enitharmons smiles & tears prevaild over self protection
They rather chose to meet Eternal death than to destroy
The offspring of their Care & Pity Urthonas spectre was comforted
But Tharmas most rejoicd in hope of Enions return
For he beheld new Female forms born forth upon the air 
Who wove soft silken veils of covering in sweet rapturd trance
Mortal & not as Enitharmon without a covering veil
First his immortal spirit drew Urizen Shadow away t
From out the ranks of war separating him in sunder
Leaving his Spectrous form which could not be drawn away 0
Then he divided Thiriel the Eldest of Urizens sons
Urizen became Rintrah Thiriel became Palamabron
Thus dividing the powers of Every Warrior
Startled was Los he found his Enemy Urizen now
In his hands. he wonderd that he felt love & not hate 
His whole soul loved him he beheld him an infant
Lovely breathd from Enitharmon he trembled within himself
