                Chapter II emphasizes the ongoing nature of creation, with Los continuing to forge and shape the material world. The creative process is depicted as continuous and evolving, highlighting the persistence and dedication required in artistic endeavors. The tension between Los and Urizen becomes more pronounced in this chapter, symbolizing the broader conflict between imagination and reason.

1: The Immortal stood frozen amidst
The vast rock of eternity; times
And times; a night of vast durance:
Impatient, stifled, stiffend, hardned.
2: Till impatience no longer could bear 
The hard bondage, rent: rent, the vast solid
With a crash from immense to immense
3: Crack'd across into numberless fragments
The Prophetic wrath, strug'ling for vent
Hurls apart, stamping furious to dust 
And crumbling with bursting sobs; heaves
The black marble on high into fragments
4: Hurl'd apart on all sides, as a falling
Rock: the innumerable fragments away
Fell asunder; and horrible vacuum 
Beneath him & on all sides round.
5: Falling, falling! Los fell & fell
Sunk precipitant heavy down down
Times on times, night on night, day on day
Truth has bounds. Error none: falling, falling: 
Years on years, and ages on ages
Still he fell thro' the void, still a void
Found for falling day & night without end.
For tho' day or night was not; their spaces
Were measurd by his incessant whirls 
In the horrid vacuity bottomless.
6: The Immortal revolving; indignant
First in wrath threw his limbs, like the babe
New born into our world: wrath subsided
And contemplative thoughts first arose 
Then aloft his head rear'd in the Abyss
And his downward-borne fall. chang'd oblique
7: Many ages of groans: till there grew
Branchy forms. organizing the Human
Into finite inflexible organs. 
8: Till in process from falling he bore
Sidelong on the purple air, wafting
The weak breeze in efforts oerwearied
9: Incessant the falling Mind labour'd
Organizing itself: till the Vacuum 
Became element, pliant to rise, Or to fall, or to swim, or to fly:
With ease searching the dire vacuity
