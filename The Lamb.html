A child asks a lamb if it knows who has created it, bid it graze in the meadow beside the stream, given it delightful and cozy fleece, and sweet soft voice that fills the valleys with joy. The child does not wait for the answer He himself answers his questions. He tells the lamb that his creator calls himself a Lamb. He is meek and mild, and came on earth as a little child. Then he remarks that he, a child and it, a lamb are called by the name of God (i.e. are manifestations of the same Godhead). They are united with the Almighty Being by virtue of their innocence, gentleness and meekness. Then he wished that God might bless it.

        Little Lamb, who made thee?
<p>Dost thou know who made thee?
    <p>Gave thee life, and bid thee feed,
        <p>By the stream and o'er the mead;
            <p>Gave thee clothing of delight,
                <p>Softest clothing, woolly, bright;
                    <p>Gave thee such a tender voice,
                        <p>Making all the vales rejoice?
                            <p>Little Lamb, who made thee?
                                <p>Dost thou know who made thee?

                                    <p>Little Lamb, I'll tell thee,
                                        <p>Little Lamb, I'll tell thee.
                                            <p>He is called by thy name,
                                                <p>For He calls Himself a Lamb.
                                                    <p>He is meek, and He is mild;
                                                        <p>He became a little child.
                                                            <p>I a child, and thou a lamb,
