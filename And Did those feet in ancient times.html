                In William Blake’s ‘Jerusalem’ or ‘And did those feet in ancient time,’ the changes brought in by the Industrial Revolution for human society are compared to the changes brought in by the end of nomadic living for early humans. Comparing times gone by to the present often yields a sense of nostalgia and sadness in thinkers. A sense of yearning for a more simplistic time is not an uncommon desire at all and is something that is commonly reflected in various kinds of art today.

        And did those feet in ancient time
<p>Walk upon England's mountains green?</p>
    <p>And was the holy Lamb of God</p>
        <p>On England's pleasant pastures seen?</p>

            <p>And did the Countenance Divine</p>
                <p>Shine forth upon our clouded hills?</p>
                    <p>And was Jerusalem builded here</p>
                        <p>Among these dark satanic mills?</p>

                            <p>Bring me my bow of burning gold!</p>
                                <p>Bring me my arrows of desire!</p>
                                    <p>Bring me my spear! O clouds, unfold!</p>
                                        <p>Bring me my chariot of fire!</p>

                                            <p>I will not cease from mental fight,</p>
                                                <p>Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand,</p>
