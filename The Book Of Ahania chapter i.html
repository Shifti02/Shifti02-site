                 Fuzon, the fiery son of Urizen, rebels against his father, symbolizing the clash between youthful energy and the established order.

  Fuzonâ€™s rebellion represents the drive for freedom and the resistance against restrictive systems and ideologies. Urizen responds with wrath and a curse, illustrating the authoritative and controlling aspects of his character.

  The curse signifies the oppressive power of established order and the harsh consequences of rebellion against it. Ahania, the wife of Urizen, falls as a result of the conflict.

1: Fuzon, on a chariot iron-wing'd
On spiked flames rose; his hot visage
Flam'd furious! sparkles his hair & beard
Shot down his wide bosom and shoulders.
On clouds of smoke rages his chariot 
And his right hand burns red in its cloud
Moulding into a vast globe, his wrath
As the thunder-stone is moulded.
Son of Urizens silent burnings
2: Shall we worship this Demon of smoke, 
Said Fuzon, this abstract non-entity
This cloudy God seated on waters
Now seen, now obscur'd; King of sorrow?
3: So he spoke, in a fiery flame,
On Urizen frowning indignant, 
The Globe of wrath shaking on high
Roaring with fury, he threw
The howling Globe: burning it flew
Lengthning into a hungry beam. Swiftly
4: Oppos'd to the exulting flam'd beam 
The broad Disk of Urizen upheav'd
Across the Void many a mile.
5: It was forg'd in mills where the winter
Beats incessant; ten winters the disk
Unremitting endur'd the cold hammer. 
6: But the strong arm that sent it, remember'd
The sounding beam; laughing it tore through
That beaten mass: keeping its direction
The cold loins of Urizen dividing.
7: Dire shriek'd his invisible Lust 
Deep groan'd Urizen! stretching his awful hand
Ahania (so name his parted soul)
He siez'd on his mountains of jealousy.
He groand anguishd & called her Sin, 
Kissing her and weeping over her; 
Then hid her in darkness in silence;
Jealous tho' she was invisible.
8: She fell down a faint shadow wandring
In chaos and circling dark Urizen,
As the moon anguishd circles the earth; 
Hopeless! abhorrd! a death-shadow,
Unseen, unbodied, unknown,
The mother of Pestilence.
9: But the fiery beam of Fuzon
Was a pillar of fire to Egypt 
Five hundred years wandring on earth
Till Los siezd it and beat in a mass
With the body of the sun.
