                "The School Boy" is a poem written in the pastoral tradition that focuses on the downsides of formal learning. It considers how going to school on a summer day "drives all joy away".[3] The boy in this poem is more interested in escaping his classroom than he is with anything his teacher is trying to teach.

        I love to rise in a summer morn
<p>When the birds sing on every tree;
    <p>The distant huntsman winds his horn,
        <p>And the skylark sings with me.
            <p>O! what sweet company!

                <p>But to go to school on a summer morn,
                    <p>O! it drives all joy away;
                        <p>Under a cruel eye outworn,
                            <p>The little ones spend the day
                                <p>In sighing and dismay.

                                    <p>Ah! then at times I drooping sit,
                                        <p>And spend many an anxious hour,
                                            <p>Nor in my book can I take delight,
                                                <p>Nor sit in learning's bower,
                                                    <p>Worn thro' with the dreary shower.

                                                        <p>How can the bird that is born for joy
                                                            <p>Sit in a cage and sing?
                                                                <p>How can a child, when fears annoy,
                                                                    <p>But droop his tender wing,
                                                                        <p>And forget his youthful spring?

                                                                            <p>O! father and mother, if buds are nipped
                                                                                <p>And blossoms blown away,
                                                                                    <p>And if the tender plants are stripped
                                                                                        <p>Of their joy in the springing day,
                                                                                            <p>By sorrow and care's dismay,

                                                                                                <p>How shall the summer arise in joy,
                                                                                                    <p>Or the summer's fruits appear?
                                                                                                        <p>Or how shall we gather what griefs destroy,
                                                                                                            <p>Or bless the mellowing year,
                                                                                                                <p>When the blasts of winter appear?
