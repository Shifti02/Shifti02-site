                Chapter I sets the stage for the cosmic struggle among the Four Zoas, who are personifications of the fundamental aspects of the human soul. These Zoas are:

Tharmas - representing the body and primal instincts.
Urthona (Los) - representing imagination and creativity.
Urizen - representing reason and law.
Luvah (Orc) - representing love and emotion.

Lost! Lost! Lost! are my Emanations Enion O Enion  
We are become a Victim to the Living We hide in secret  
I have hidden Jerusalem in Silent Contrition O Pity Me  
I will build thee a Labyrinth also O pity me O Enion t 
Why hast thou taken sweet Jerusalem from my inmost Soul  
Let her Lay secret in the Soft recess of darkness & silence
It is not Love I bear to It is Pity  
She hath taken refuge in my bosom & I cannot cast her out.
The Men have recieved their death wounds & their Emanations are fled 
To me for refuge & I cannot turn them out for Pitys sake
Enion said—Thy fear has made me tremble thy terrors have surrounded me  
All Love is lost Terror succeeds & Hatred instead of Love
And stern demands of Right & Duty instead of Liberty.
Once thou wast to Me the loveliest son of heaven—But now 
Why art thou Terrible and yet I love thee in thy terror till
I am almost Extinct & soon shall be a Shadow in Oblivion
Unless some way can be found that I may look upon thee & live
Hide me some Shadowy semblance. secret whispring in my Ear
In secret of soft wings. in mazes of delusive beauty 
I have lookd into the secret soul of him I lovd
And in the Dark recesses found Sin & cannot return
Trembling & pale sat Tharmas weeping in his clouds 
Why wilt thou Examine every little fibre of my soul
Spreading them out before the Sun like Stalks of flax to dry 
The infant joy is beautiful but its anatomy
Horrible Ghast & Deadly nought shalt thou find in it
But Death Despair & Everlasting brooding Melancholy
Thou wilt go mad with horror if thou dost Examine thus
Every moment of my secret hours Yea I know 
That I have sinnd & that my Emanations are become harlots
I am already distracted at their deeds & if I look
Upon them more Despair will bring self murder on my soul
O Enion thou art thyself a root growing in hell
Tho thus heavenly beautiful to draw me to destruction 
Sometimes I think thou art a flower expanding
Sometimes I think thou art fruit breaking from its bud
In dreadful dolor & pain & I am like an atom
A Nothing left in darkness yet I am an identity
I wish & feel & weep & groan Ah terrible terrible

<p class="poisontree">In Eden,Females sleep the winter in soft silken veils t
Woven by their own hands to hide them in the darksom grave
But Males immortal live renewd by female deaths. in soft
Delight they die & they revive in spring with music & songs
Enion said Farewell I die I hide. from thy searching eyes 
So saying—From her bosom weaving soft in Sinewy threads
A tabernacle for Jerusalem she sat among the Rocks  
Singing her lamentation. Tharmas groand among his Clouds
Weeping, then bending from his Clouds he stoopd his innocent head  
And stretching out his holy hand in the vast Deep sublime 
Turnd round the circle of Destiny with tears & bitter sighs
And said. Return O Wanderer when the Day of Clouds is oer
So saying he sunk down into the sea a pale white corse
In torment he sunk down & flowd among her filmy Woof t
His Spectre issuing from his feet in flames of fire 
In gnawing pain drawn out by her lovd fingers every nerve t
She counted. every vein & lacteal threading them among
Her woof of terror. Terrified & drinking tears of woe
Shuddring she wove—nine days & nights Sleepless her food was tears
Wondring she saw her woof begin to animate. & not 
As Garments woven subservient to her hands but having a will
Of its own perverse & wayward Enion lovd & wept
Nine days she labourd at her work. & nine dark sleepless nights
But on the tenth trembling morn the Circle of Destiny Complete t
Round rolld the Sea Englobing in a watry Globe self balancd  
A Frowning Continent appeard Where Enion in the Desart
Terrified in her own Creation viewing her woven shadow
Sat in a dread intoxication of Repentance & Contrition t
There is from Great Eternity a mild & pleasant rest
Namd Beulah a Soft Moony Universe feminine lovely 
Pure mild & Gentle given in Mercy to those who sleep
Eternally. Created by the Lamb of God around
On all sides within & without the Universal Man
The Daughters of Beulah follow sleepers in all their Dreams t
Creating Spaces lest they fall into Eternal Death 
The Circle of Destiny complete they gave to it a Space
And namd the Space Ulro & brooded over it in care & love
They said The Spectre is in every man insane & most
Deformd Thro the three heavens descending in fury & fire
We meet it with our Songs & loving blandishments & give 
To it a form of vegetation But this Spectre of Tharmas
Is Eternal Death What shall we do O God pity & help  
So spoke they & closd the Gate of the Tongue in trembling fear  
What have I done! said Enion accursed wretch! What deed.  
Is this a deed of Love I know what I have done. I know 
Too late now to repent. Love is changd to deadly Hate  
A [ ll ]life is blotted out & I alone remain possessd with Fears  
I see the Shadow of the dead within my Soul wandering  
In darkness & solitude forming Seas of Doubt & rocks of Repentance t
Already are my Eyes reverted. all that I behold 
Within my Soul has lost its splendor & a brooding Fear
Shadows me oer & drives me outward to a world of woe
So waild she trembling before her own Created Phantasm t
<p class="poisontree">[ PAGE6 ]
<p class="poisontree">She drew the Spectre forth from Tharmas in her shining loom t
Of Vegetation weeping in wayward infancy & sullen youth
Listning to her soft lamentations soon his tongue began
To Lisp out words & soon in masculine strength augmenting he
Reard up a form of gold & stood upon the glittering rock 
A shadowy human form winged & in his depths
The dazzlings as of gems shone clear, rapturous in fury  
Glorying in his own eyes Exalted in terrific Pride  
The Spectre thus spoke. Who art thou Diminutive husk & shell  
If thou hast sinnd & art polluted know that I am pure  
And unpolluted & will bring to rigid strict account
All thy past deeds [ So ]hear what I tell thee! mark it well! remember!  
This world is Thine in which thou dwellest that within thy soul  
That dark & dismal infinite where Thought roams up & down 
Is Mine & there thou goest when with one Sting of my tongue  
Envenomd thou rolist inwards to the place whence I emergd  
She trembling answerd Wherefore was I born & what am I  
I thought to weave a Covering for my Sins from wrath of Tharmas  
<p class="poisontree">[ PAGE7 ]
<p class="poisontree">I thought Tharmas a Sinner & I murderd his Emanations  
His secret loves & Graces Ah me wretched What have I done  
For now I find that all those Emanations were my Childrens Souls  
And I have murderd them with Cruelty above atonement  
Those that remain have fled from my cruelty into the desarts 
And thou the delusive tempter to these deeds sittest before me  
In this thy world not mine tho dark I feel my world within  
Mingling his horrible brightness with her tender limbs then high she soard  
Above the ocean; a bright wonder that Nature shudder'd at  
Half Woman & half Spectre, all his lovely changing colours mix  
With her fair crystal clearness; in her lips & cheeks his poisons rose  
In blushes like the morning, and his scaly armour softening t
A monster lovely in the heavens or wandering on the earth, t
<p class="poisontree">[ PAGE8 ]
<p class="poisontree">Till with fierce pain she brought forth on the rocks her sorrow & woe
Behold two little Infants wept upon the desolate wind.  
The first state weeping they began & helpless as a wave
Beaten along its sightless way growing enormous in its motion to
Its utmost goal, till strength from Enion like richest summer shining  
Raisd the bright boy & girl with glories from their heads out beaming  
Drawing forth drooping mothers pity drooping mothers sorrow  
They sulk upon her breast her hair became like snow on mountains  
Weaker & weaker, weeping woful, wearier and wearier
Faded & her bright Eyes decayd melted with pity & love 
<p class="poisontree">[ PAGE9 ]
<p class="poisontree">And then they wanderd far away she sought for them in vain  
In weeping blindness stumbling she followd them oer rocks & mountains
Rehumanizing from the Spectre in pangs of maternal love
Ingrate they wanderd scorning her drawing her Spectrous Life
Repelling her away & away by a dread repulsive power 
Into Non Entity revolving round in dark despair.
And drawing in the Spectrous life in pride and haughty joy  
Thus Enion gave them all her spectrous life  
Then Eno a daughter of Beulah took a Moment of Time  
And drew it out to Seven thousand years with much care & affliction  
And many tears & in Every year made windows into Eden   
She also took an atom of space & opend its center
Into Infinitude & ornamented it with wondrous art
Astonishd sat her Sisters of Beulah to see her soft affections
To Enion & her children & they ponderd these things wondring 
And they Alternate kept watch over the Youthful terrors
They saw not yet the Hand Divine for it was not yet reveald
But they went on in Silent Hope & Feminine repose
But Los & Enitharmon delighted in the Moony spaces of Eno  
Nine Times they livd among the forests, feeding on sweet fruits 
And nine bright Spaces wanderd weaving mazes of delight
Snaring the wild Goats for their milk they eat the flesh of Lambs
A male & female naked & ruddy as the pride of summer
Alternate Love & Hate his breast; hers Scorn & Jealousy
In embryon passions. they kiss'd not nor embrac'd for shame & fear  
His head beamd light & in his vigorous voice was prophecy
He could controll the times & seasons, & the days & years
She could controll the spaces, regions, desart, flood & forest
But had no power to weave a Veil of covering for her Sins
She drave the Females all away from Los 
And Los drave all the Males from her away
They wanderd long, till they sat down upon the margind sea.
Conversing with the visions of Beulah in dark slumberous bliss  
But the two youthful wonders wanderd in the world of Tharmas t
Thy name is Enitharmon; said the fierce prophetic boy  
While thy mild voice fills all these Caverns with sweet harmony
O how our Parents sit & mourn in their silent secret bowers t
<p class="poisontree">[ PAGE1O ]
But Enitharmon answerd with a dropping tear & frowning t
Dark as a dewy morning when the crimson light appears t
To make us happy let them weary their immortal powers t
While we draw in their sweet delights while we return them scorn t
On scorn to feed our discontent; for if we grateful prove 
They will withhold sweet love, whose food is thorns & bitter roots.
We hear the warlike clarions we view the turning spheres t
Yet Thou in indolence reposest holding me in bonds
Hear! I will sing a Song of Death! it is a Song of Vala! t
The Fallen Man takes his repose: Urizen sleeps in the porch  
Luvah and Vala woke & flew up from the Human Heart t
Into the Brain; from thence upon the pillow Vala slumber'd.
And Luvah siez'd the Horses of Light, & rose into the Chariot of Day
Sweet laughter siezd me in my sleep! silent & close I laughd t
For in the visions of Vala I walkd with the mighty Fallen One  
I heard his voice among the branches, & among sweet flowers. t 
Why is the light of Enitharmon darken'd in dewy morn t
Why is the silence of Enitharmon a terror & her smile a whirlwind t
Uttering this darkness in my halls, in the pillars of my Holy-ones
Why dost thou weep as Vala? & wet thy veil with dewy tears,  
In slumbers of my night-repose, infusing a false morning?
Driving the Female Emanations all away from Los  
I have refusd to look upon the Universal Vision
And wilt thou slay with death him who devotes himself to thee t
Once born for the sport & amusement of Man now born to drink up all his Powers 
<p class="poisontree">[ PAGE11 ]
<p class="poisontree">I heard the sounding sea; I heard the voice weaker and weaker;
The voice came & went like a dream, I awoke in my sweet bliss.
Then Los smote her upon the Earth twas long eer she revivd
He answer'd, darkning more with indignation hid in smiles t
I die not Enitharmon tho thou singst thy Song of Death  
Nor shalt thou me torment For I behold the Fallen Man t
Seeking to comfort Vala, she will not be comforted t
She rises from his throne and seeks the shadows of her garden
Weeping for Luvah lost, in the bloody beams of your false morning
Sickning lies the Fallen Man his head sick his heart faint  
Mighty atchievement of your power! Beware the punishment
I see, invisible descend into the Gardens of Vala
Luvah walking on the winds, I see the invisible knife
I see the shower of blood: I see the swords & spears of futurity
Tho in the Brain of Man we live, & in his circling Nerves. 
Tho' this bright world of all our joy is in the Human Brain.
Where Urizen & all his Hosts hang their immortal lamps
Thou neer shalt leave this cold expanse where watry Tharmas mourns
So spoke Los. Scorn & Indignation rose upon Enitharmon
Then Enitharmon reddning fierce stretchd her immortal hands  
Descend O Urizen descend with horse & chariots
Threaten not me O visionary thine the punishment
The Human Nature shall no more remain nor Human acts
Form the rebellious Spirits of Heaven. but War & Princedom & Victory & Blood t
<p class="poisontree">[ PAGE12 ]
<p class="poisontree">Night darkend as she spoke! a shuddring ran from East to West t
A Groan was heard on high. The warlike clarions ceast. the Spirits
Of Luvah & Vala shudderd in their Orb: an orb of blood! t
Eternity groand & was troubled at the Image of Eternal Death
The Wandering Man bow'd his faint head and Urizen descended 
And the one must have murderd the other if he had not descended  
Indignant muttering low thunders; Urizen descended
Gloomy sounding, Now I am God from Eternity to Eternity
Sullen sat Los plotting Revenge. Silent he eye'd the Prince  
Of Light. Silent the prince of Light viewd Los. at length a brooded  
Smile broke from Urizen for Enitharmon brightend more & more
Sullen he lowerd on Enitharmon but he smild on Los
Saying Thou art the Lord of Luvah into thine hands I give
The prince of Love the murderer his soul is in thine hands
Pity not Vala for she pitied not the Eternal Man 
Nor pity thou the cries of Luvah. Lo these starry hosts
They are thy servants if thou wilt obey my awful Law
Los answerd furious art thou one of those who when most complacent
Mean mischief most. If you are such Lo! I am also such
One must be master. try thy Arts I also will try mine 
For I percieve Thou hast Abundance which I claim as mine
Urizen startled stood but not Long soon he cried
Obey my voice young Demon I am God from Eternity to Eternity
Thus Urizen spoke collected in himself in awful pride
Art thou a visionary of Jesus the soft delusion of Eternity 
Lo I am God the terrible destroyer & not the Saviour
Why should the Divine Vision compell the sons of Eden
to forego each his own delight to war against his Spectre  
The Spectre is the Man the rest is only delusion & fancy
So spoke the Prince of Light & sat beside the Seat of Los 
Upon the sandy shore rested his chariot of fire
Ten thousand thousand were his hosts of spirits on the wind:
Ten thousand thousand glittering Chariots shining in the sky:
They pour upon the golden shore beside the silent ocean.
Rejoicing in the Victory & the heavens were filld with blood  
The Earth spread forth her table wide. the Night a silver cup
Fill'd with the wine of anguish waited at the golden feast
But the bright Sun was not as yet; he filling all the expanse
Slept as a bird in the blue shell that soon shall burst away
Los saw the wound of his blow he saw he pitied he wept  
Los now repented that he had smitten Enitharmon he felt love
Arise in all his Veins he threw his arms around her loins
To heal the wound of his smiting
They eat the fleshly bread, they drank the nervous wine  
<p class="poisontree">[ PAGE13 ]
<p class="poisontree">They listend to the Elemental Harps & Sphery Song
They view'd the dancing Hours, quick sporting thro' the sky
With winged radiance scattering joys thro the ever changing light
But Luvah & Vala standing in the bloody sky  
On high remaind alone forsaken in fierce jealousy 
They stood above the heavens forsaken desolate suspended in blood
Descend they could not. nor from Each other avert their eyes
Eternity appeard above them as One Man infolded
In Luvah robes of blood & bearing all his afflictions  
As the sun shines down on the misty earth Such was the Vision 
But purple night and crimson morning & golden day descending  
Thro' the clear changing atmosphere display'd green fields among
The varying clouds, like paradises stretch'd in the expanse
With towns & villages and temples, tents sheep-folds and pastures
Where dwell the children of the elemental worlds in harmony, 
Not long in harmony they dwell, their life is drawn away  
And wintry woes succeed; successive driven into the Void
Where Enion craves: successive drawn into the golden feast
And Los & Enitharmon sat in discontent & scorn  
The Nuptial Song arose from all the thousand thousand spirits  
Over the joyful Earth & Sea, and ascended into the Heavens
For Elemental Gods their thunderous Organs blew; creating
Delicious Viands. Demons of Waves their watry Eccho's woke!
Bright Souls of vegetative life, budding and blossoming  
<p class="poisontree">[ PAGE14 ]
<p class="poisontree">Stretch their immortal hands to smite the gold & silver Wires
And with immortal Voice soft warbling fill all Earth & Heaven.
With doubling Voices & loud Horns wound round sounding
Cavernous dwellers fill'd the enormous Revelry, Responsing!
And Spirits of Flaming fire on high, govern'd the mighty Song. 
And This the Song! sung at The Feast of Los & Enitharmon
Ephraim calld out to Zion: Awake O Brother Mountain  
Let us refuse the Plow & Spade, the heavy Roller & spiked
Harrow. burn all these Corn fields. throw down all these fences
Fattend on Human blood & drunk with wine of life is better far 
Than all these labours of the harvest & the vintage. See the river
Red with the blood of Men. swells lustful round my rocky knees
My clouds are not the clouds of verdant fields & groves of fruit
But Clouds of Human Souls. my nostrils drink the lives of Men  
The Villages Lament. they faint outstretchd upon the plain15
Wailing runs round the Valleys from the Mill & from the Barn t 
But most the polishd Palaces dark silent bow with dread  
Hiding their books & pictures. underneath the dens of Earth
The Cities send to one another saying My sons are Mad
With wine of cruelty. Let us plat a Scourge O Sister City  
Children are nourishd for the Slaughter; once the Child was fed
With Milk; but wherefore now are Children fed with blood t

Tharmas endurd not, he fled howling. then a barren waste sunk>
Conglobing in the dark confusion, Mean time Los was born
And Thou O Enitharmon! Hark I hear the hammers of Los t 
<p class="poisontree">[ PAGE16 ]
<p class="poisontree">They melt the bones of Vala, & the bones of Luvah into wedges
The innumerable sons & daughters of Luvah closd in furnaces
Melt into furrows. winter blows his bellows: ice & Snow
Tend the dire anvils. Mountains mourn & Rivers faint & fail
There is no City nor Corn-field nor Orchard! all is Rock & Sand 
There is no Sun nor Moon nor Star. but rugged wintry rocks
Justling together in the void suspended by inward fires
Impatience now no longer can endure. Distracted Luvah
Bursting forth from the loins of Enitharmon, Thou fierce Terror
Go howl in vain, Smite Smite his fetters Smite O wintry hammers0
Smite Spectre of Urthona, mock the fiend who drew us down
From heavens of joy into this Deep. Now rage but rage in vain 
Thus Sang the Demons of the Deep. the Clarions of War blew loud
The Feast redounds & Crownd with roses & the circling vine
The Enormous Bride & Bridegroom sat, beside them Urizen 
With faded radiance sighd, forgetful of the flowing wine
And of Ahania his Pure Bride but She was distant far
But Los & Enitharmon sat in discontent & scorn
Craving the more the more enjoying, drawing out sweet bliss
From all the turning wheels of heaven & the chariots of the Slain 
At distance Far in Night repelld. in direful hunger craving
Summers & Winters round revolving in the frightful deep.
<p class="poisontree">[ PAGE17 ]
<p class="poisontree">Enion blind & age-bent wept upon the desolate wind t
Why does the Raven cry aloud and no eye pities her?
Why fall the Sparrow & the Robin in the foodless winter?
Faint! shivering they sit on leafless bush, or frozen stone t
Wearied with seeking food across the snowy waste; the little 
Heart, cold; and the little tongue consum'd, that once in thoughtless joy
Gave songs of gratitude to waving corn fields round their nest. t
Why howl the Lion & the Wolf? why do they roam abroad? t
Deluded by summers heat they sport in enormous love t
And cast their young out to the hungry wilds & sandy desarts 
<p class="poisontree">[ PAGE18 ]
<p class="poisontree">Why is the Sheep given to the knife? the Lamb plays in the Sun
He starts! he hears the foot of Man! he says, Take thou my wool
But spare my life, but he knows not that winter cometh fast. t
The Spider sits in his labourd Web, eager watching for the Fly
Presently comes a famishd Bird & takes away the Spider 
His Web is left all desolate, that his little anxious heart
So careful wove; & spread it out with sighs and weariness.
This was the Lamentation of Enion round the golden Feast
Eternity groand and was troubled at the image of Eternal Death
Without the body of Man an Exudation from his sickning limbs 
Now Man was come to the Palm tree & to the Oak of Weeping t
Which stand upon the Edge of Beulah & he sunk down
From the Supporting arms of the Eternal Saviour; who disposd
The pale limbs of his Eternal Individuality
Upon The Rock of Ages. Watching over him with Love & Care t

For messengers from Beulah come in tears & darkning clouds
Saying Shiloh is in ruins our brother is sick Albion He t

Enitharmon remains a corse such thing was never known 
In Eden that one died a death never to be revivd
Urthona stood in terror but not long his spectre fled
To Enion & his body fell. Tharmas beheld him fall
Endlong a raging serpent rolling round the holy tent
The sons of war astonishd at the Glittring monster drove 0
Him far into the world of Tharmas into a cavernd rock
But Urizen with darkness overspreading all the armies
Sent round his heralds secretly commanding to depart
Into the north Sudden with thunders sound his multitudes
Retreat from the fierce conflict all the sons of Urizen at once 
Mustring together in thick clouds leaving the rage of Luvah
To pour its fury on himself & on the Eternal Man
Sudden down fell they all together into an unknown Space
Deep horrible without End. Separated from Beulah far beneath
The Mans exteriors are become indefinite opend to pain 0
In a fierce hungring void & none can visit his regions
<p class="poisontree">[ PAGE21 [19] ]
<p class="poisontree">Jerusalem his Emanation is become a ruin t
Her little ones are slain on the top of every street t
And she herself le captive & scatterd into the indefinite t
Gird on thy sword O thou most mighty in glory & majesty
Destroy these opressors of Jerusalem & those who ruin Shiloh 
So spoke the Messengers of Beulah. Silently removing
The Family Divine drew up the Universal tent
Above High Snowdon & closd the Messengers in clouds around t
Till the time of the End. Then they Elected Seven. called the Seven
Eyes of God & the Seven lamps of the Almighty 0
The Seven are one within the other the Seventh is named Jesus 
The Lamb of God blessed for ever & he followd the Man
Who wanderd in mount Ephraim seeking a Sepulcher
His inward eyes closing from the Divine vision & all
His children wandering outside from his bosom fleeing away t 
<p class="poisontree">[ PAGE22 [20] ]
<p class="poisontree">The Daughters of Beulah beheld the Emanation they pitied t
They wept before the Inner gates of Enitharmons bosom
And of her fine wrought brain & of her bowels within her loins
Three gates within Glorious & bright open into Beulah t
From Enitharmons inward parts but the bright female terror 
Refusd to open the bright gates she closd and barrd them fast
Lest Los should enter into Beulah thro her beautiful gates
The Emanation stood before the Gates of Enitharmon t
Weeping. the Daughters of Beulah silent in the Porches
Spread her a couch unknown to Enitharmon here reposd 
Jerusalem in slumbers soft lulld into silent rest
Terrific ragd the Eternal Wheels of intellect terrific ragd
The living creatures of the wheels in the Wars of Eternal life
But perverse rolld the wheels of Urizen & Luvah back reversd
Downwards & outwards consuming in the wars of Eternal Death t
