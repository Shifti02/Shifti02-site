                The transformation from formlessness to form is central to this chapter. Los's organs are depicted as roots shooting out, symbolizing growth and development from an initial state of chaos. This separation can also be seen as a metaphor for the distinction between different aspects of existence, such as the physical and the spiritual.

        <p class="poisontree">Chap: III
<p class="poisontree">1: The Lungs heave incessant, dull and heavy
For as yet were all other parts formless 
Shiv'ring: clinging around like a cloud
Dim & glutinous as the white Polypus
Driv'n by waves & englob'd on the tide.
2: And the unformed part crav'd repose
Sleep began: the Lungs heave on the wave 
Weary overweigh'd, sinking beneath
In a stifling black fluid he woke
3: He arose on the waters, but soon
Heavy falling his organs like roots
Shooting out from the seed, shot beneath, 
And a vast world of waters around him
In furious torrents began.
4: Then he sunk, & around his spent Lungs
Began intricate pipes that drew in
The spawn of the waters. Outbranching 
<p class="poisontree">[ PLATE5 ]
<p class="poisontree">An immense Fibrous form, stretching out
Thro' the bottoms of immensity raging.
5: He rose on the floods: then he smote
The wild deep with his terrible wrath,
Seperating the heavy and thin. 
6: Down the heavy sunk; cleaving around
To the fragments of solid: up rose
The thin, flowing round the fierce fires
That glow'd furious in the expanse.
