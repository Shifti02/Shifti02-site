                The Purpose behind William Blake's "Why Was cupid a boy?" was to explain the difficulties of love by using the stereotypes of cupid's gender and age, also explaining his importance in Greek culture. He Explains that men have a lesser understanding of love because it deals with emotions.

        Why was Cupid a boy,
<p>And why a boy was he?
    <p>He should have been a girl,
        <p>For aught that I can see.

            <p>For he shoots with his bow,
                <p>And the girl shoots with her eye,
                    <p>And they both are merry and glad,
                        <p>And laugh when we do cry.

                            <p>And to make Cupid a boy
                                <p>Was the Cupid girl's mocking plan;
                                    <p>For a boy can't interpret the thing
                                        <p>Till he is become a man.

                                            <p>And then he's so pierc'd with cares,
                                                <p>And wounded with arrowy smarts,
                                                    <p>That the whole business of his life
                                                        <p>Is to pick out the heads of the darts.

                                                            <p>'Twas the Greeks' love of war
                                                                <p>Turn'd Love into a boy,
                                                                    <p>And woman into a statue of stone-
                                                                        <p>And away fled every joy.
