                Los's astonishment and terror at the sight of Urizen's backbone indicate the challenges inherent in the creative process. Los's efforts to bind Urizen using furnaces, anvils, and adamant hammers highlight the struggle to impose order and structure on the chaotic elements. The chapter concludes with the formation of a human illusion, as Urizen's brain forms a rock and his heart forms a fleshy slough, creating rivers that obscure the immense orb of fire.

I: Then Light first began; from the fires10
Beams, conducted by fluid so pure .
Flow'd around the Immense: Los beheld
Forthwith writhing upon the dark void
The Back bone of Urizen appear
Hurtling upon the wind 
Like a serpent! like an iron chain
Whirling about in the Deep. 
2: Upfolding his Fibres together
To a Form of impregnable strength
Los astonish'd and terrified, built 
Furnaces; he formed an Anvil
A Hammer of adamant then began
The binding of Urizen day and night
3: Circling round the dark Demon, with howlings
Dismay & sharp blightings; the Prophet 
Of Eternity beat on his iron links
4: And first from those infinite fires
The light that flow'd down on the winds
lie siez'd; beating incessant, condensing
The subtil particles in an Orb. 
5: Roaring indignant the bright sparks
Endur'd the vast Hammer; but unwearied
Los beat on the Anvil; till glorious
An immense Orb of fire be fram'd
6: Oft he quench'd it beneath in the Deeps 
Then surveyd the all bright mass. Again
Siezing fires from the terrific Orbs
He heated the round Globe, then beat
While roaring his Furnaces endur'd
The chaind Orb in their infinite wombs 
7: Nine ages completed their circles
When Los heated the glowing mass, casting
It down into the Deeps: the Deeps fled
Away in redounding smoke; the Sun
Stood self-balanc'd. And Los smild with joy. 
He the vast Spine of Urizen siez'd
And bound down to the glowing illusion
8: But no light, for the Deep fled away
On all sides, and left an unform'd
Dark vacuity: here Urizen lay 
In fierce torments oil his glowing bed
9: Till his Brain in a rock, & his Heart
In a fleshy slough formed four rivers
Obscuring the immense Orb of fire
Flowing down into night: till a Form 
Was completed, a Human Illusion
In darkness and deep clouds involvd.
