        Golden Apollo, that thro' heaven wide
<p>Scatter'st the rays of light, and truth's beams,
    <p>In lucent words my darkling verses dight,
        <p>And wash my earthy mind in thy clear streams,
            <p>That wisdom may descend in fairy dreams,
                <p>All while the jocund hours in thy train
                    <p>Scatter their fancies at thy poet's feet;
                        <p>And when thou yields to night thy wide domain,
                            <p>Let rays of truth enlight his sleeping brain.
                                <p>For brutish Pan in vain might thee assay
                                    <p>With tinkling sounds to dash thy nervous verse,
                                        <p>Sound without sense; yet in his rude affray,
                                            <p>(For ignorance is Folly's leasing nurse
                                                <p>And love of Folly needs none other's curse)
                                                    <p>Midas the praise hath gain'd of lengthen'd ears,
                                                        <p>For which himself might deem him ne'er the worse
                                                            <p>To sit in council with his modern peers,
                                                                <p>And judge of tinkling rimes and elegances terse.

                                                                        <p>Dost mount aloft into the yielding sky,
                                                                            <p>And thro' Heav'n's halls thy airy flight dost throw,
                                                                                <p>Entering with holy feet to where on high
                                                                                    <p>Jove weighs the counsel of futurity;
                                                                                        <p>Then, laden with eternal fate, dost go
Down, like a falling star, from autumn sky,
<p>And o'er the surface of the silent deep dost fly:

    <p>If thou arrivest at the sandy shore
        <p>Where nought but envious hissing adders dwell,
            <p>Thy golden rod, thrown on t 1000 he dusty floor,
                <p>Can charm to harmony with potent spell.
                    <p>Such is sweet Eloquence, that does dispel
                        <p>Envy and Hate that thirst for human gore;
                            <p>And cause in sweet society to dwell
                                <p>Vile savage minds that lurk in lonely cell

                                    <p>O Mercury, assist my lab'ring sense
                                        <p>That round the circle of the world would fly,
                                            <p>As the wing'd eagle scorns the tow'ry fence
                                                <p>Of Alpine hills round his high aëry,
                                                    <p>And searches thro' the corners of the sky,
                                                        <p>Sports in the clouds to hear the thunder's sound,
                                                            <p>And see the wingèd lightnings as they fly;
                                                                <p>Then, bosom'd in an amber cloud, around
                                                                    <p>Plumes his wide wings, and seeks Sol's palace high.

                                                                        <p>And thou, O warrior maid invincible,

                                                                                        <p>In solemn gloom of branches interwove?

                                                                                                <p>Where, like the sea, the waves of battle move?
                                                                                                    <p>Or have thy soft piteous eyes beheld
                                                                                                        <p>The weary wanderer thro' the desert rove?
                                                                                                            <p>Or does th' afflicted man thy heav'nly bosom move?
