                 This poem is typical of the Romantic period in its celebration of nature and love. The speaker roams through a field, enjoying the sights and sounds of summer, when they are suddenly struck by the beauty of the sun. The sun leads the speaker to a garden, where they are given gifts of lilies and roses. The speaker is then caught in the sun's "silken net" and imprisoned in its "goldn cell."

Like other Romantic poems, this one uses imagery and metaphor to create a sense of wonder and beauty. The sun is described as a lover that leads the speaker on a journey of discovery. The garden is a place of abundance and beauty, and the speaker is overcome with joy and happiness.

The poem also reflects the social and political context of the Romantic period. The speaker is a free spirit that roams the land, enjoying the beauty of nature. This is in contrast to the industrialization and urbanization that was occurring at the time. The poem offers a vision of a world where people can live in harmony with nature and each other.

        <p> How sweet I roam'd from field to field,
<p>And tasted all the summer's pride
<p>'Til the prince of love beheld
<p>Who in the sunny beams did glide!

<p>He shew'd me lilies for my hair
<p>And blushing roses for my brow;
<p>He led me through his garden fair,
<p>Where all his golden pleasures grow.

<p>With sweet May dews my wings were wet,
<p>And Phoebus fir'd my vocal rage
<p>He caught me in his silken net,
<p>And shut me in his golden cage.

<p>He loves to sit and hear me sing,
<p>Then, laughing, sports and plays with me;
<p>Then stretches out my golden wing,
<p>And mocks my loss of liberty.
