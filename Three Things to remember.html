                “Three Things to Remember,” manages to be terrible, honest and beautiful all at once using elements of rhyme, realism and figurative language with brilliant cadence. William Blake's rhyme is neither elementary nor frivolous, instead it is powerful and irrefutable. It demands to be both heard and felt. assailing the ears with sound that is avoid both unpleasant simplicity and overbearing strength. It is brazenly candid, particularly in Blake’s use of metaphors; he seems to almost dare his readers to question his judgments stated so clearly. Blake plainly regards the hiding or imprisoning of something as innocent as a songbird to be the greatest of sins: angering all of heaven and pleasing no man. In fact, Blake expresses that harm of any kind befalling the innocent is a horrid tragedy to be avoided at all costs. Whether, Blake’s songbirds are an allusion to nature, the innocent and naïve, children, or simply stand as themselves, they serve to guilt with impunity any offender of what Blake’s assured notions of morality.
