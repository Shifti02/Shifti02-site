                The poem begins with a reflection on the nature of love and the limitations of understanding and appreciating others. It suggests that individuals cannot truly love or venerate others more than themselves, and the poem opens with a reflection on this limitation of love.
The speaker, a little boy, questions his ability to love his father or brothers more than himself, drawing a comparison to a little bird that loves by picking up crumbs around the door. The childâ€™s innocent and simple expression of love contrasts with the complex theological and philosophical questions raised by the priest in the subsequent stanzas.

        Nought loves another as itself,
<p>Nor venerates another so,</p>
    <p>Nor is it possible to thought</p>
        <p>A greater than itself to know.</p>

            <p>'And, father, how can I love you</p>
                <p> Or any of my brothers more? </p>
                    <p> I love you like the little bird </p>

                            <p> The Priest sat by and heard the child; </p>
                                <p> In trembling zeal he seized his hair, </p>
