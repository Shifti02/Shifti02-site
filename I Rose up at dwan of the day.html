                        The Poet talks about themes of materialism and the rejection of societal norms. The speaker possesses contentment in life, yet lacks material wealth, which is seen as a temptation symbolized by Mammon. The speaker refuses to pray for riches, valuing instead their spiritual and emotional well-being.

                    <p>I rose up at the dawn of day--
                        <p>`Get thee away! get thee away!
                            <p>Pray'st thou for riches? Away! away!
                                <p>This is the Throne of Mammon grey.'
                    
                                    <p>Said I: This, sure, is very odd;
                                        <p>I took it to be the Throne of God.
                                            <p>For everything besides I have:
                                                <p>It is only for riches that I can crave.
                    
                                                    <p>I have mental joy, and mental health,
                                                        <p>And mental friends, and mental wealth;
                                                            <p>I've a wife I love, and that loves me;
                                                                <p>I've all but riches bodily.
                    
                                                                    <p>I am in God's presence night and day,
                                                                        <p>And He never turns His face away;
                                                                            <p>The accuser of sins by my side doth stand,
                                                                                <p>And he holds my money-bag in his hand.
                    
                                                                                    <p>For my worldly things God makes him pay,
                                                                                        <p>And he'd pay for more if to him I would pray;
                                                                                            <p>And so you may do the worst you can do;
                                                                                                <p>Be assur'd, Mr. Devil, I won't pray to you.
                    
                                                                                                    <p>Then if for riches I must not pray,
                                                                                                        <p>God knows, I little of prayers need say;
                                                                                                            <p>So, as a church is known by its steeple,
                                                                                                                <p>If I pray it must be for other people.
                    
                                                                                                                    <p>He says, if I do not worship him for a God,
                                                                                                                        <p>I shall eat coarser food, and go worse shod;
                                                                                                                            <p>So, as I don't value such things as these,
                                                                                                                                <p>You must do, Mr. Devil, just as God please.
