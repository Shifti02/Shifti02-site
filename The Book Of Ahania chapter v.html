                Ahania's lamentation for Fuzon is central to this chapter. Her grief is profound and all-encompassing, symbolizing the universal experience of loss and mourning. Urizen's reflection on his actions and their consequences highlights the theme of authoritarianism. His rigid control and the subsequent rebellion have led to profound sorrow and loss.
The narrative explores the destructive nature of authoritarian rule and its impact on both the ruler and the ruled.

1:<p class="poisontree"> The lamenting voice of Ahania45
Weeping upon the void.
And round the Tree of Fuzon:
Distant in solitary night
Her voice was heard, but no form
Had she: but her tears from clouds 
Eternal fell round the Tree
2: And the voice cried: Ah Urizen! Love!
Flower of morning! I weep on the verge
Of Non-entity; how wide the Abyss
Between Ahania and thee! 
3: I lie on the verge of the deep.
I see thy dark clouds ascend,
I see thy black forests and floods,
A horrible waste to my eyes!
4: Weeping I walk over rocks 
Over dens & thro' valleys of death
Why didst thou despise Ahania
To cast me from thy bright presence
Into the World of Loneness
5: I cannot touch his hand: 
Nor weep on his knees, nor hear 
His voice & bow, nor see his eyes
And joy, nor hear his footsteps, and
My heart leap at the lovely sound!
I cannot kiss the place 
Whereon his bright feet have trod,
<p class="poisontree">[ PLATE5 ]
<p class="poisontree">But I wander on the rocks
With hard necessity.
6: Where is my golden palace
Where my ivory bed
Where the joy of my morning hour 
Where the sons of eternity, singing
7: To awake bright Urizen my king!
To arise to the mountain sport,
To the bliss of eternal valleys:
8: To awake my king in the morn! 
To embrace Ahanias joy
On the bredth of his open bosom:
From my soft cloud of dew to fall
In showers of life on his harvests.
9: When he gave my happy soul 
To the sons of eternal joy:
When he took the daughters of life.
Into my chambers of love:
10: When I found babes of bliss on my beds.
And bosoms of milk in my chambers 
Fill'd with eternal seed
O! eternal births sung round Ahania
In interchange sweet of their joys.
11: Swell'd with ripeness & fat with fatness
Bursting on winds my odors, 
My ripe figs and rich pomegranates
In infant joy at thy feet
O Urizen, sported and sang;
12: Then thou with thy lap full of seed
With thy band full of generous fire 
Walked forth from the clouds of morning
On the virgins of springing joy,
On the human soul to cast
The seed of eternal science.
13: The sweat poured down thy temples 
To Ahania return'd in evening 
The moisture awoke to birth
My mothers-joys, sleeping in bliss.
14: But now alone over rocks, mountains
Cast out from thy lovely bosom: 
Cruel jealousy! selfish fear!
Self-destroying: how can delight,
Renew in these chains of darkness
Where bones of beasts are strown
On the bleak and snowy mountains 
Where bones from the birth are buried
Before they see the light.
