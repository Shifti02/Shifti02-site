                In this poem William Blake at the beginning speaks about an angel, who was singing in the small hours every day. An angel was singing all day about mercy, pity, peace, which is the world´s release. Angel was positive feature. He tried to help people. His voice is really beautiful and people feel good during his singing. Devil cursed mercy, pity and peace, because he saw all men are happy in the world and they don´t need any mercy, pity or peace. At a devil´s curse the sun went down and it started heavy rain for three days. Devil do not know people, what they need.

        I heard an Angel Singing
<p>When the day was springing:
    <p>'Mercy, pity, and peace,
        <p>Are the world's release.'

            <p>So he sang all day
                <p>Over the new-mown hay,
                    <p>Till the sun went down,
                        <p>And the haycocks looked brown.

                            <p>I heard a devil curse
                                <p>Over the heath and the furse:
                                    <p>'Mercy vould be no more
                                        <p>If there were nobody poor,
                                            <p>And pity no more could be
                                                <p>If all were happy as ye:
                                                    <p>And mutual fear brings peace,
                                                        <p>Misery's increase
                                                            <p>Are mercy, pity, and peace.'

                                                                <p>At his curse the sun went down,
<p>And the heavens gave a frown.
