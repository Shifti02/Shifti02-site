                The poem presents a contrast between innocence and experience, a common theme in Blake's work. It depicts a gray-haired monk who serves as a symbol of experience. The monk is described as being "wiser" and "older," suggesting a deeper understanding of life's complexities. His gray hair symbolizes wisdom gained through age and experience.

    The poem also mentions a "Hermit" who represents innocence. The hermit is described as being "white" and "glowing," symbolizing purity and naivety. The contrast between the gray monk and the white hermit highlights the dichotomy between experience and innocence. And became a Tyrant in his stead.'

        <p> 1 'I die, I die!' the Mother said,
<p>'My children die for lack of bread.
<p> What more has the merciless Tyrant said?'
<p> The Monk sat down on the stony bed.

<p> The blood red ran from the Grey Monk's side,
<p> His hands and feet were wounded wide,
<p> His body bent, his arms and knees
<p> Like to the roots of ancient trees.

<p> His eye was dry; no tear could flow:
<p> A hollow groan first spoke his woe.
<p> He trembled and shudder'd upon the bed;
<p> At length with a feeble cry he said:

<p> 'When God commanded this hand to write
<p> In the studious hours of deep midnight,
<p> He told me the writing I wrote should prove
<p> The bane of all that on Earth I lov'd.

<p> My Brother starv'd between two walls,
<p> His Children's cry my soul appalls;
<p> I mock'd at the rack and griding chain,
<p> My bent body mocks their torturing pain.

<p> Thy father drew his sword in the North,
<p> With his thousands strong he marched forth;
<p> Thy Brother has arm'd himself in steel
<p> To avenge the wrongs thy Children feel.

<p> But vain the Sword and vain the Bow,
<p> They never can work War's overthrow.
<p> The Hermit's prayer and the Widow's tear
<p> Alone can free the World from fear.

<p> For a Tear is an intellectual thing,
<p> And a Sigh is the sword of an Angel King,
<p> And the bitter groan of the Martyr's woe
<p> Is an arrow from the Almighty's bow.

<p> The hand of Vengeance found the bed
<p> To which the Purple Tyrant fled;
<p> The iron hand crush'd the Tyrant's head
<p> And became a Tyrant in his stead.'
