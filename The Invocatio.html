                Blake Invokes the daughters of Beulah, the Muses who inspire the poet's song, to aid him in recording the journey of the immortal poet Milton. The passage speaks of Milton's journey through realms of terror and mild moonlit beauty. The Muses are called upon to descend down the nerves of the poet's arm, then Blake incorporates biblical imagery and themes into the passage, referencing Jesus as the "image of the Invisible God" and his sacrifice as an offering and atonement for eternal death.

        <p class="poisontree">Daughters of Beulah! Muses who inspire the Poet's Song,
Record the journey of immortal Milton thro' your realms
Of terror and mild moony lustre, in soft Sexual delusions
Of vari√®d beauty, to delight the wanderer, and repose
His burning thirst and freezing hunger! Come into my hand,
By your mild power descending down the nerves of my right arm
From out the portals of my Brain, where by your ministry
The Eternal Great Humanity Divine planted His Paradise,
And in it caus'd the Spectres of the Dead to take sweet form
In likeness of Himself. Tell also of the False Tongue, vegetated
Beneath your land of Shadows, of its sacrifices and
Its offerings; even till Jesus, the image of the Invisible God,
Became its prey; a curse, an offering, and an atonement
For Death Eternal, in the Heavens of Albion, and before the Gates
Of Jerusalem his Emanation, in the Heavens beneath Beulah!
