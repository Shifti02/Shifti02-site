                Homer is portrayed as a poet inspired by the Muses, representing a direct connection to divine inspiration. This aligns with Blake's belief in the importance of inspiration and the prophetic role of the artist. Virgil, while also a great poet, is seen as more constrained by the political and cultural expectations of his time, particularly the influence of the Romans.

        <p class="poisontree">ON HOMERS POETRY t
<p class="poisontree">Every Poem must necessarily be a perfect Unity, but why Homers is peculiarly so, I cannot tell: he has told the story of Bellerophon & omitted the judgmet of Paris which is not only a part, but a principal part of Homers subject

But when a Work has Unity it is as much in a Part as in the Whole. the Torso is as much a Unity as the Laocoon

As Unity is the cloke of folly so Goodness is the cloke of knavery Those who will have Unity exclusively in Homer come out with a Moral like a sting in the tail: Aristotle says Characters are either Good or Bad: now Goodness or Badness has nothing to do with Character. an Apple tree a Pear tree a Horse a Lion, are Characters but a Good Apple tree or a Bad, is an Apple tree still: a Horse is not more a Lion for being a Bad Horse. that is its Character; its Goodness or Badness is another consideration.

It is the same with the Moral of a whole Poem as with the Moral Goodness
 
of its parts Unity & Morality, are secondary considerations & belong to Philosophy & not to Poetry, to Exception & not to Rule, to Accident & not to Substance. the Ancients calld it eating of the tree of good & evil.

The Classics, it is the Classics! & not Goths nor Monks, that Desolate Europe with Wars.

<p class="poisontree"></p>ON VIRGIL
<p class="poisontree"></p>Sacred Truth has pronounced that Greece & Rome as Babylon & Egypt: so far from being parents of Arts & Sciences as they pretend: were destroyers of all Art. Homer Virgil & Ovid confirm this opinion & make us reverence The Word of God, the only light of antiquity that remains unperverted by War. Virgil in the Eneid Book VI. line 848 says Let others study Art: Rome has somewhat better to do, namely War & Dominion

Rome & Greece swept Art into their maw & destroyd it a Warlike State never can produce Art. It will Rob & Plunder & accumulate into one place, & Translate & Copy & Buy & Sell & Criticise, but not Make.

Mathematic Form is Eternal in the Reasoning Memory. Living Form is Eternal Existence.

Grecian is Mathematic Form

Gothic is Living Form
