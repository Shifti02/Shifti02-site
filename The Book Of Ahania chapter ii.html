                Ahania, the embodiment of sorrow and suffering, laments the state of the world and her own desolation.

  Her lament highlights the emotional and spiritual impact of the conflict, emphasizing themes of loss, sorrow, and the search for meaning amidst chaos.

<p class="poisontree">Chap: II: d
1: But the forehead of Urizen gathering,
And his eyes pale with anguish, his lips
Blue & changing; in tears and bitter
Contrition he prepar'd his Bow,
2: Form'd of Ribs: that in his dark solitude 
When obscur'd in his forests fell monsters,
Arose. For his dire Contemplations
Rush'd down like floods from his mountains
In torrents of mud settling thick
With Eggs of unnatural production 
Forthwith hatching; some howl'd on his hills
Some in vales; some aloft flew in air
3: Of these: an enormous dread Serpent
Scaled and poisonous horned
Approach'd Urizen even to his knees 
As he sat on his dark rooted Oak.
4: With his horns he push'd furious.
Great the conflict & great the jealousy
In cold poisons: but Urizen smote him
5: First he poison'd the rocks with his blood 
Then polish'd his ribs, and his sinews
Dried; laid them apart till winter;
Then a Bow black prepar'd; on this Bow,
A poisoned rock plac'd in silence:
He utter'd these words to the Bow.  
6: O Bow of the clouds of secresy!
O nerve of that lust form'd monster!
Send this rock swift, invisible thro'
The black clouds, on the bosom of Fuzon
7: So saying, In torment of his wounds, 
He bent the enormous ribs slowly;
A circle of darkness! then fixed
The sinew in its rest: then the Rock
Poisonous source! plac'd with art, lifting difficult
Its weighty bulk: silent the rock lay. 
8: While Fuzon his tygers unloosing
Thought Urizen slain by his wrath.
I am God. said he, eldest of things!
9: Sudden sings the rock, swift & invisible
On Fuzon flew, enter'd his bosom; 
His beautiful visage, his tresses,
That gave light to the mornings of heaven
Were smitten with darkness, deform'd
And outstretch'd on the edge of the forest
10: But the rock fell upon the Earth, 
Mount Sinai, in Arabia.
