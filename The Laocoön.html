                William Blake's "Laocoön" is a fascinating and complex work that combines visual art with a rich tapestry of inscriptions and commentary, reflecting Blake's unique religious and philosophical beliefs. Created around 1826, the piece is a pen and ink etching that features the famous Hellenistic sculpture of Laocoön and his sons being attacked by serpents, overlaid with Blake's handwritten notes and aphorisms

[Jehovah]& his two Sons Satan & Adam as they were copied from the
       Cherubim Of Solomons Temple by three Rhodians & applied to
       Natural Fact. or. History of Ilium
[Above the father's head:]

The Angel of the Divine Presence
Hebrew text
[Angel of Jehovah]
Greek text
[Serpent-holder]
He repented that he had made Adam
(of the Female, the Adamah)
& it grieved him at his heart
[About the serpent and figure (? Satan) to the right:]

Good
Hebrew text
[Lilith]
Satans Wife The Goddess Nature is War & Misery & Heroism a Miser
[About the serpent and figure (? Adam) to the left:]

Evil
Good & Evil are

Riches & Poverty a Tree of Misery
propagating Generation & Death

[Remaining aphorisms, reading outward in thematic order:]

What can be Created Can be Destroyed
Adam is only The Natural Man & not the Soul or Imagination

The Eternal Body of Man is The IMAGINATION.
        God himself          |
that is                           |

image of Erdman's layout of the above portion of Laocoon
[Yeshua]JESUS We are his Members
        The Divine Body  |
It manifests itself in his Works of Art (In Eternity All is Vision)
All that we See is VISION from Generated Organs gone as soon as come
Permanent in The Imagination; considered as Nothing by the NATURAL MAN
HEBREW ART is called SIN by the Deist SCIENCE
The whole Business of Man Is The Arts & All Things Common
 
Christianity is Art & not Money
Money is its Curse
The Old & New Testaments are the Great Code of Art
Jesus & his Apostles & Disciples were all Artists
Their Works were destroyd by the Seven Angels of the Seven Churches in Asia. Antichrist Science
SCIENCE is the Tree of DEATH
ART is the Tree of LIFE GOD is JESUS
The Gods of Priam are the Cherubim of Moses & Solomon The Hosts of Heaven
The Gods of Greece & Egypt were Mathematical Diagrams See Plato's Works
There are States in which all Visionary Men are accounted Mad
Men such are Greece & Rome Such is Empire or Tax
See Luke Ch 2 v I
Art Degraded Imagination Denied War Governed the Nations
Divine Union Deriding And Denying Immediate Communion with God
The Spoilers say Where are his Works That he did in the Wilderness
Lo what are these Whence came they These are not the Works
Of Egypt nor Babylon Whose Gods are the Powers of this World. Goddess, Nature. t
Who first spoil & then destroy Imaginative Art For their Glory is War and Dominion
Empire against Art See Virgils Eneid. Lib. VI. v 848
Spiritual War
Israel deliverd from Egypt is Art deliverd from Nature & Imitation
What we call Antique Gems are the Gems of Aarons Breast Plate
Prayer is the Study of Art
Praise is the Practise of Art
Fasting &c. all relate to Art
The outward Ceremony is Antichrist
Without Unceasing Pracise nothing can be done
Practise is Art If you leave off you are Lost
A Poet a Painter a Musician an Architect: the Man
Or Woman who is not one of these is not a Christian
You must leave Fathers & Mothers & Houses & Lands if they stand in the way of ART
The unproductive Man is not a Christian much less the Destroyer
 
The True Christian Charity not dependent on Money (the lifes blood of Poor Families) that is on Caesar or Empire or Natural Religion
For every Pleasure Money Is Useless
Money, which is The Great Satan or Reason the Root of Good & Evil In The Accusation of Sin
Where any view of Money exists Art cannot be carried on, but War only (Read Matthew CX. 9 & 10 v) by pretences to the Two Impossibilities Chastity & Abstinence Gods of the Heathen
Is not every Vice possible to Man described in the Bible openly
All is not Sin that Satan calls so all the Loves & Graces of Eternity.
If Morality was Christianity Socrates was the Saviour
Art can never exist without Naked Beauty displayed
