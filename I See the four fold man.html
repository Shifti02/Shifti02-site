                This poem, part of a series of prophetic works, explores the Four-fold Man, an archetype representing the different aspects of human consciousness. The speaker witnesses the "Humanity in deadly sleep," trapped by the Spectre (rationalism) and its Shadow (sensualism). The poem reflects Blake's critique of the Enlightenment, symbolized by Bacon and Newton, whose scientific and rationalist ideas are seen as oppressive, refusing creativity and individuality.

The speaker implores divine assistance to awaken Albion, the symbol of England, from this state of intellectual slumber. The imagery of the "Loom of Locke," with its "Water-wheels of Newton," represents the industrialization and mechanization that Blake saw as dehumanizing and destructive.

        <p> I see the Four-fold Man, The Humanity in deadly sleep
<p>And its fallen Emanation, the Spectre and its cruel Shadow.
<p>I see the Past, Present and Future existing all at once
<p>Before me. O Divine Spirit, sustain me on thy wings,
<p>That I may awake Albion from his long and cold repose;
<p>For Bacon and Newton, sheath'd in dismal steel, their terrors hang
<p>Like iron scourges over Albion: reasonings like vast serpents
<p>Infold around my limbs, bruising my minute articulations.

<p>I turn my eyes to the schools and universities of Europe
<p>And there behold the Loom of Locke, whose Woof rages dire,
<p>Wash'd by the Water-wheels of Newton: black the cloth
<p>In heavy wreaths folds over every nation: cruel works
<p>Of many Wheels I view, wheel without wheel, with cogs tyrannic
<p>Moving by compulsion each other, not as those in Eden, which,
<p>Wheel within wheel, in freedom revolve in harmony and peace.
