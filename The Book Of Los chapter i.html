                Chapter I introduces the context and actions of Los, the blacksmith figure in Blakeâ€™s mythology, who is associated with creative power and artistic endeavor. The chapter lays the foundation for understanding Los's role in the material creation and his opposition to Urizen, the embodiment of reason and law.

<p class="poisontree">LOS
<p class="poisontree">Chap. I
<p class="poisontree">1: Eno aged Mother,
Who the chariot of Leutha guides,
Since the day of thunders in old time
2: Sitting beneath the eternal Oak
Trembled and shook the stedfast Earth 
And thus her speech broke forth.
3: O Times remote!
When Love & joy were adoration:
And none impure were deem'd.
Not Eyeless Covet 
Nor Thin-lip'd Envy
Nor Bristled Wrath
Nor Curled Wantonness
4: But Covet was poured full:
Envy fed with fat of lambs: 
Wrath with lions gore:
Wantonness lulld to sleep
With the virgins lute,
Or sated with her love. 
5: Till Covet broke his locks & bars, 
And slept with open doors:
Envy sung at the rich mans feast:
Wrath was follow'd up and down
By a little ewe lamb
And Wantonness on his own true love 
Begot a giant race:
6: Raging furious the flames of desire
Ran thro' heaven & earth, living flames
Intelligent, organiz'd: arm'd
With destruction & plagues. In the midst 
The Eternal Prophet bound in a chain
Compell'd to watch Urizens shadow
7: Rag'd with curses & sparkles of fury
Round the flames roll as Los hurls his chains
Mounting up from his fury, condens'd 
Rolling round & round, mounting on high
Into vacuum: into non-entity.
Where nothing was! dash'd wide apart
His feet stamp the eternal fierce-raging
Rivers of wide flame; they roll round 
And round on all sides making their way
Into darkness and shadowy obscurity
8: Wide apart stood the fires: Los remain'd
In the void between fire and fire
In trembling and horror they beheld him 
They stood wide apart, driv'n by his hands
And his feet which the nether abyss
Stamp'd in fury and hot indignation
9: But no light from the fires all was
<p class="poisontree">[ PLATE4 ]
<p class="poisontree">Darkness round Los: heat was not; for bound up
Into fiery spheres from his fury
The gigantic flames trembled and hid
1O: Coldness, darkness, obstruction, a Solid
Without fluctuation, hard as adamant 
Black as marble of Egypt; impenetrable
Bound in the fierce raging Immortal,
And the seperated fires froze in
A vast solid without fluctuation,
Bound in his expanding clear senses
