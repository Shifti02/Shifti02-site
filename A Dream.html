                The first lines of A Dream’ begin with the speaker desiring how they were lying in their bed, protected by their guardian angel. While there, they dreamed that an ant was wandering lost in the grass (near where they were lying). The speaker goes on to personify the ant, describing it as “confused.” He heard the ant speak as well. She mourns for herself wonders what her children and their dad are thinking about her. 
The speaker is moved by what the ant is going through and cries for her. Then, a nearby glow-worm speaks to the ant, asking what is going on. The worm is there, he says, to illuminate the earth when the beetle walks around. It’s easy enough to listen to the sound of the beetle walking, he notes, and follow that home.

        Once a dream did weave a shade
<p>O'er my angel-guarded bed,</p>
    <p>That an emmet lost its way</p>
        <p>Where on grass methought I lay.</p>

            <p>Troubled, wildered, and forlorn,</p>
                <p> Dark, benighted, travel-worn, </p>
                    <p> Over many a tangle spray, </p>
                        <p> All heart-broke, I heard her say: </p>

                            <p> 'Oh my children! do they cry, </p>
                                <p> Do they hear their father sigh? </p>
                                    <p> Now they look abroad to see, </p>
                                        <p> Now return and weep for me.' </p>

                                            <p> Pitying, I dropped a tear: </p>
                                                <p> But I saw a glow-worm near, </p>
