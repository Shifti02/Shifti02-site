                    This poem talks about the dream that the speaker dreamed throughout his life. In his dream, he appears as a maiden queen, and a guardian angel protects the queen all day. The poem’s first four lines depict the speaker in a state of perfect innocence the angel protects. However, sometimes, she pretends to be sad to get the angel’s attention but discovers that stupidity cannot seduce the angel’s guidance. In the second stanza, the speaker shares further characteristics of that angel who was there to protect her during her trying times.
Being a good angel, he defended the queen from despair and hardships. However, there comes a time when the angel takes his wings and flees, leaving the dreamer confused. At this point, the dreamer realized that she has to protect herself, and she does so. She fought her battle and saved herself from all odds until, one day, the angel returned to the dreamer, but it was too late. The maiden queen has become a strong warrior, and now she does not need any protection. She has learned the art of fighting throughout her life.

                I dreamt a dream! What can it mean?
                    <p>And that I was a maiden Queen</p>
                        <p>Guarded by an Angel mild:</p>
                            <p>Witless woe was ne'er beguiled!</p>
                
                                <p>And I wept both night and day,</p>
                                    <p>And he wiped my tears away;</p>
                                        <p>And I wept both day and night,</p>
                                            <p>And hid from him my heart's delight.</p>
                
                                                <p>So he took his wings, and fled;</p>
                                                    <p>Then the morn blushed rosy red.</p>
                                                        <p>I dried my tears, and armed my fears</p>
                                                            <p>With ten-thousand shields and spears.</p>
                
                                                                <p>Soon my Angel came again;</p>
